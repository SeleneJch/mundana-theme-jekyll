Hi! This is Dionne.

This page is for Sal, who made the template I'm using now.

He said,

<blockquote cite="https://www.wowthemes.net/donate/">

	<p> "I believe in open source philosophy and I think this will be the great future. Why compete when we can cooperate and become better?&nbsp;

	Over time I have published quite a good collection of free open source projects now used by thousands of people. And I couldn't be happier.&nbsp;

	If for some reason you want to reward my work, I'd feel really appreciated. You would help me tremendously!
	and the blog is not actually, I'm not good at design."&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

And I also belive in open source and it's a great template, I gave him a token of my gratitude.
