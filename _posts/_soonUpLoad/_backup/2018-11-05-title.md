[Can i optimize incomplete likelihood?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/134498/225061)

- In statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model, given observations. MLE attempts to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function, given the observations.
