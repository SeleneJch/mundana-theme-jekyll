2. Sperber and Wilson (1981) treats verbal irony as type of echoic allusion

3. Eisterhold et al. (2006), Reactions to irony in discourse: evidence for the least disruption principle
sarcasm can be understood in terms of the response it elicits. They observe that the responses to sarcasm may be laughter, zero response, smile, sarcasm (in return), a change of topic (because the listener was
not happy with the caustic sarcasm), literal reply and non-verbal reactions.
