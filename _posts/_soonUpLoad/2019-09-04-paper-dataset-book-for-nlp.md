## Paper

`I wrote down some papers before, but now, it's been overloaded in NLP industry, so now, I'm considering I can't put it down all over the things. `

#### Pre-training

- BERT [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)

- GPT-2: [Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf)

#### AI Ethics

- Tolga Bolukbasiet al, 2019 [Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06520)

- Nikhil Garg et al, 2017 [Word Embeddings Quanfity 100 Years of Gender and Ethnic Stereotypes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08412.pdf)

## Dataset
