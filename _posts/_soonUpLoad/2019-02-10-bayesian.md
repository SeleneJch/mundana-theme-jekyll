### Best question


#### Question 3.2 - 3.3

1. Which of the following scenarios could we most appropriately model using an exponentially distributed random variable?
2. The number of failed lightbulbs in a batch of 5000 after 100 hours in service
	> This is a discrete count. The exponential distribution is for a continuous random variable.

3. The lifetime in hours of a particular lightbulb
4. The hours of service until all light bulbs in a batch of 5000 fail

	> This is a positive, continuous quantity. However, it is not the most appropriate option available since it is the sum of 5000 random variables, which by the central limit theorem CLT could be approximated with a normal distribution.
5. The probability of a light bulb failure before 100 hours in service

#### Question 10
The normal distribution is also linear in the sense that if X $\sim \text{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)X∼N(μ,σ^2)$, then for any real constants $a\ne 0$ and $b\ne 0$ b, the distribution of $Y = aX + b$ is distributed $\text{N}(a\mu + b, a^2\sigma^2)$.

Using this fact, what is the distribution of $Z = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$?
