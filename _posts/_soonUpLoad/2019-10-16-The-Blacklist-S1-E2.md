## Day 15

### S1 E2 - 03 - He's name is Tom Keen

**Cooper:** His name's tom Keen. Schoolteacher, 4th grade.
He's currently in a medically induced coma, was nearly killed last week during an altercation on a case Keen was working.

**Fowler:** He gonna survive?

**Cooper:** The situation is uncertain.
**Fowler:** You're confident that the husband's not involved with Reddington?

**Cooper:** No.
The truth is we don't have any idea who Reddington may be involved with.

**Fowler:** Then why should we trust him?

**Raddington:** You're asking the wrong questions.
I'm trying to help you with a matter of some urgency.
It's your choice whether you listen to me or not, but there will be an incident at 11:00 this morning at the decatur industrial park.
I would send ambulances.

**Cooper:** We need to move quickly.

**Woman:** He's a prisoner.
He has no legal position to negotiate from.

**Man:** Charge him under the patriot act.
See what he has to say then.

**Cooper:** He'll only speak with Keen.

**Woman:** It's not up to him.
We decide who he speaks... 

**Cooper:** I don't think you understand how delicately the situation needs to be handled. Reddington has brokered some of the most comprehensive international criminal activity in the past 20 years.
He has access to targets we don't even know exist.
Now, he's telling us there may be some kind of an event about to happen at the decatur industrial park.
**Fowler:** I don't think you understand.
You don't run the criminal division of main justice. I do.
The Attorney General is not going to accept a deal.
Reddington is a criminal, and we're gonna take credit for catching him.
Our office will lay out the charges.
**Cooper:** I hope you understand that from time t... 

**Fowler:** there is... No... Deal. Am I clear?
