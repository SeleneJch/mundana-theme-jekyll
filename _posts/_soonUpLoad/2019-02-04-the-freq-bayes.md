1) In what ways could the frequentist paradigm be considered objective? In what ways could the Bayesian paradigm be considered objective?

- The frequentist can be considered objective because they have lots of samples, they gave us average. The Bayesian calculate what little data can be unpredictable. That's objectivity.

2) Identify ways in which each paradigm might be considered subjective.

- The frequentist set the ideal parameter. And they want to find it on a large scale data. However, Bayesian does not settle/assume any parameters in advance. What matters is what value the data has. But that point the Bayesian has prior information. That's the point why the Bayesian is subjective.

3) Review what other learners have posted, and either respond to a previous post or add one of your own.
