When I was volunteer, it seems like busy and hectic to managing that crowded conference.<br />
In my experience, to get things moving, it needs **hierarchy**.<br />
But it didn't. Organizers emphasized our responsibility, and if I passed each other's burden, It could be my burden next time.<br />
In solidarity of the obligation, we finished conference well.<br />
And after participating PyCon Korea 2018 as volunteer, I've joined PyCon Korea Organizer last year.<br/>

It's been a while since PyCon 2019 finished. It's held on Aug 15 - 18, at Coex Grand Balloom<br />

- Serving as part of the code of conduct committee, I spent large fraction of last year doing CoC job.

First half: Before the conference


- Formally we've been reusing and modifying PyCon US CoC but we needed fit in Korean, and I was part of that to revise code of conduct.


### Toward Diverse Community 

### Except 'That' Diversity, Because it is 'Harassment'

Second half: During the conference

### Handling the potential Harassment

### Disjunction of policy and real-time situation
