When I was volunteer, it seems like busy and hectic to managing that crowded conference.<br />
In my experience, to get things moving, it needs **hierarchy**.<br />
But it didn't. Organizers emphasized our responsibility, and if I passed each other's burden, It could be my burden next time.<br />
In solidarity of the obligation, we finished conference well.<br />
And after participating PyCon Korea 2018 as volunteer, I've joined PyCon Korea Organizer last year.<br/>
