When I was volunteer, it seems like busy and hectic to managing that crowded conference.<br />
In my experience, to get things moving, it needs **hierarchy**.<br />
But it didn't. Organizers emphasized our responsibility, and if I passed each other's burden, It could be my burden next time.<br />
In solidarity of the obligation, we finished conference well.<br />
And after participating PyCon Korea 2018 as volunteer, I've joined PyCon Korea Organizer last year.<br/>

It's been a while since PyCon 2019 finished. It's held on Aug 15 - 18, at Coex Grand Balloom<br />

- Serving as part of the coc TF, I spent large fraction of last year doing CoC job.
here's the path what we've been grappled with to grasp a solution.

**First half: Before the conference**

#### Toward Diverse Community 

- Formally we've been reusing and modifying PyCon US CoC, but we needed fit in Korean and I was part of that to revise code of conduct.

#### Except 'That' Diversity, Because it is 'Harassment'

 - Specific point was harassment, and the others were not. process of finding the points. How can we settle this point?

**Second half: During the conference**

#### Handling the potential Harassment

#### Disjunction of policy and real-time situation
