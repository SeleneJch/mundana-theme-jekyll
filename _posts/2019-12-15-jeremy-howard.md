- The person who made me start Computer Vision again. He said, "It's not just something I can throw away. NLP and computer vision a few weeks apart and that's going to force your brain to realize like 'oh I have to remember this'"

- "Keep going.  You're not expected to remember everything. Yet.  You're not expected to understand everything. Yet. You're not expected to know why everything works.  Yet."
