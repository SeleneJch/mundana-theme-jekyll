Hey fellow reader,

This is my first blog post here. I have been procrastinating making this blog for some years now. Always waiting for the right time, the right theme and platform....the excuses never end. Abruptly one day, I decided to go for a jekyll theme a friend recommended and just pour here what comes to my mind and I'd like to document. I realized maybe the former reasons where just excuses for not start the blog but what stopped me was another problem, which is the fear of actually coming out to the public and my blog not having any benefit to provide for others. That's when I internally realized I'm totally contradicting myself and a blog is not made for this purpose, but quite the opposite, it's supposed to be my personal space where I express myself and document my stories. So, this happened and I hope I enjoy the process and that somehow someone might bump into it while aimlessly browsing the interwebs and it might add anything to them. The Blog doesn't have a specific category or purpose in the meantime while I'm starting it, but maybe this will change. so far, you can find topics to read through and it shall cover different aspects of my life, career and hobbies.


Buckle up!
