- I often confuse that y is scalar, not a vector.

#### 2.3 Gradients backward pass

- Gradients is output with respect to parameter
- we've done this work in this path(below)

![](/assets/images/4-calculus.jpeg)

- to simplify this calculus, we can just change it into

$$ y=f(u) $$,
$$ u=g(x) $$

- So, you should know of the derivative of each bit on its own, and then you multiply them all together. As a result, it would be \$$dy$$ over \$$dx$$ cross over the data.

- So you can get gradient, output with respect to parameter

- What order should we calculate?

BTW, why Jeremy wrote <script type="math/tex">\hat y</script>, not *Loss function*?[^1]

##### decompose function

- We want to get derivative of <script type="math/tex"> w_1 </script> which forms <script type="math/tex">t=x_1 @ w_1 + b_1</script>
- But, we have a estimation of answer (*we call it y hat*) now
- So, I will decompose funciton to trace target variable.

$$ \overset{\rightharpoonup}{u}\ \ linear_1\ \ \overset{\rightharpoonup}{w}\ \ ReLU\ \ \overset{\rightharpoonup}{v}\ \ linear_2\ \ \overset{\rightharpoonup}{a}\ \ MSE = \hat y $$

- Using the above forward pass, we can suppose some function from the end.
- start from <script type="math/tex">  \hat y </script>, We know MSE funciton got two parameters, output, <script type="math/tex">u</script> and target <script type="math/tex">y</script>.
- from MSE's input we know <script type="math/tex">  linear_2</script> function's output and supposing v is input of that function, <script type="math/tex">linear_2(v) = u</script>
- similarly, *v* became output of <script type="math/tex">ReLU, ReLU(t) = v</script>

##### chain rule with code

- examplify backward process by random sampling

- To get a variable, I modified forward model a little

~~~python
def model_ping(out = 'x_train'):
    l1 = lin(x_train, w1, b1) # one linear layer
    l2 = relu(l1) # one relu layer
    l3 = lin(l2, w2, b2) # one more linear layer
    return eval(out)
~~~

- Be careful we don't use mse_loss in backward process

1) start with the very last function, which is loss funciton. MSE

![](/assets/images/4-mse.jpeg){:height="70%" width="70%"}

$$\color{red}{\frac{\partial}{\partial u}MSE(u,y)} \times\frac{\partial}{\partial v}l_2(v)\times\frac{\partial}{\partial t}ReLU(t)\times\frac{\partial}{\partial x}l_1(x)$$

- If we codify this formula, 

~~~python
def mse_grad(inp, targ):  #mse_input(1000,1), mse_targ (1000,1)
    # grad of loss with respect to output of previous layer
    inp.g = 2. * (inp.squeeze() - targ).unsqueeze(-1) / inp.shape[0]
~~~

- And, this can be examplified like below.
- Notice that input of gradient function is same with forward function

~~~python
y_hat = model_ping('l3') #get value from forward model
y_hat.g = ((y_hat.squeeze(-1)-y_train).unsqueeze(-1))/y_hat.shape[0]

y_hat.g.shape
>>> torch.Size([50000, 1])
~~~


- We can just calculate using broadcasting, not using squeeze. then why should do and unsqueeze again?<br />
ðŸŽ¯ It's related with random access memory(RAM).. If I don't *squeeze*, (I'm using colab) **it out of RAM**.

2) Derivative of linear2 function

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial u}MSE(u,y) \times\color{red}{\frac{\partial}{\partial v}l_2(v)} \times \frac {\partial}{\partial t}ReLU(t)\times\frac{\partial}{\partial x}l_1(x)$$

![](/assets/images/4-wayofbackward.jpeg)

~~~python
def lin_grad(inp, out, w, b):
    # grad of matmul with respect to input
    inp.g = out.g @ w.t()
    w.g = (inp.unsqueeze(-1) * out.g.unsqueeze(1)).sum(0)
    b.g = out.g.sum(0)
~~~

- Examplified below

~~~python
lin2 = model_ping('l2'); #get value from forward model
lin2.g = y_hat.g@w2.t(); 
w2.g = (lin2.unsqueeze(-1) * y_hat.g.unsqueeze(1)).sum(0);
b2.g = y_hat.g.sum(0);
~~~

~~~python
lin2.g.shape, w2.g.shape, b2.g.shape
>>> torch.Size([50000, 50])torch.Size([50, 1])torch.Size([1])
~~~

- Notice going reverse order, we're passing in gradient backward

3) derivative of ReLU

![](/assets/images/4-relu.png)

![](/assets/images/4-relugrad.png)

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial u}MSE(u,y) \times \frac{\partial}{\partial v}l_2(v) \times \color{red}{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}ReLU(t)}\times\frac{\partial}{\partial x}l_1(x)$$

~~~python
def relu_grad(inp, out):
    # grad of relu with respect to input activations
    inp.g = (inp>0).float() * out.g
~~~

- Examplified below

~~~python
lin1=model_ping('l1') #get value from forward model
lin1.g = (lin1>0).float() * lin2.g;
lin1.g.shape
>>> torch.Size([50000, 50])
~~~

4) Derivative of linear1

~~~python
def lin_grad(inp, out, w, b):
    # grad of matmul with respect to input
    inp.g = out.g @ w.t()
    w.g = (inp.unsqueeze(-1) * out.g.unsqueeze(1)).sum(0)
    b.g = out.g.sum(0)
~~~

- Examplified below

~~~python
x_train.g = lin1.g @ w1.t(); 
w1.g = (x_train.unsqueeze(-1) * lin1.g.unsqueeze(1)).sum(0); 
b1.g = lin1.g.sum(0);

x_train.g.shape, w1.g.shape, b1.g.shape
>>> torch.Size([50000, 784])torch.Size([784, 50])torch.Size([50])
~~~

5) Then it goes backward pass

~~~python
def forward_and_backward(inp, targ):
    # forward pass:
    l1 = inp @ w1 + b1
    l2 = relu(l1)
    out = l2 @ w2 + b2
    # we don't actually need the loss in backward!
    loss = mse(out, targ)
    
    # backward pass:
    mse_grad(out, targ)
    lin_grad(l2, out, w2, b2)
    relu_grad(l1, l2)
    lin_grad(inp, l1, w1, b1)
~~~
 
Summary
{: style="color:gray; font-size: 130%; text-align: left;"}

- Notice that output of function at forward pass became input of backward pass
- backpropagation is just the chain rule
- value loss *(loss=mse(out,targ))* is not used in gradient calcuation.
    - Because, it doesn't appear with the weight.
- w1g, w2g, b1g, b2g, ig will be used for optimizer

##### check the result using Pytorch autograd

- *require_grad_* is the magical function, which can automatic differentiation.[^2]
    - This magical auto gradified tensor **keep track** what happend in forward (taking loss function), 
    - and do the backward[^3]
    - So it saves our time to differentiate ourselves
