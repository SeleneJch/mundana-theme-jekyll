#### 2.3 Gradients backward pass

- Gradients is output with respect to parameter
- we've done this work in this path(below)

- to simplify this calculus, we can just change it into

$$ y=f(u) $$,
$$ u=g(x) $$

- So, you should know of the derivative of each bit on its own, and then you multiply them all together. As a result, it would be \$$dy$$ over \$$dx$$ cross over the data.

- So you can get gradient, output with respect to parameter

- What order should we calculate?

##### chain rule 1) start with the very last function, which is loss funciton. MSE

![](/assets/images/4-mse.jpeg){:height="70%" width="70%"}

~~~python
def mse_grad(inp, targ): 
    # grad of loss with respect to output of previous layer
    inp.g = 2. * (inp.squeeze() - targ).unsqueeze(-1) / inp.shape[0]
~~~

- Store it to **.g** attributes, so we can multiply all things together.


##### chain rule 2) derivative of ReLU

![](/assets/images/4-chain-step2.jpeg)

- Because this is chain rule, we do **(garident of ReLU) \* (gradient of output)**

- But we did gradient of output just before, which is gradient of MSE. so we can multiply it by out.g(which was inp.g before)

~~~python
def relu_grad(inp, out):
    # grad of relu with respect to input activations
    inp.g = (inp>0).float() * out.g
~~~

##### chain rule 3) Derivative of linear function

- the gradient of a matrix product is the matrix product with the transposed , \$$ inp.g = out.g \  @  \ w.t() $$

~~~python
def lin_grad(inp, out, w, b):
    # grad of matmul with respect to input
    inp.g = out.g @ w.t()
    w.g = (inp.unsqueeze(-1) * out.g.unsqueeze(1)).sum(0)
    b.g = out.g.sum(0)
~~~

##### chain rule 4) Then it goes backward pass

~~~python
def forward_and_backward(inp, targ):
    # forward pass:
    l1 = inp @ w1 + b1
    l2 = relu(l1)
    out = l2 @ w2 + b2
    # we don't actually need the loss in backward!
    loss = mse(out, targ)
    
    # backward pass:
    mse_grad(out, targ)
    lin_grad(l2, out, w2, b2)
    relu_grad(l1, l2)
    lin_grad(inp, l1, w1, b1)
~~~

### 3. Refactor model
#### 3.1 Layers as classes
#### 3.2 Modue.forward()
#### 3.3 nn.Linear and nn.Module
