2020 Annual Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics

### Why I can't use 'Cebuano' for the research?

Why I had to change target language from 'Cebuano' to 'Tagalog'?
-> No language translator options except google translation. But before knowing that I already consult my friend, whose mother tongue is English. So I had to aplogize her, but couldn't tell her why suddenly I changed my plan.
-> I realized there are many languages even can't be researched at all..

-> Getting accustomed to discrimination makes misunderstanding, sometimes. At my country, we couldn't use music streaming service, because of legal problem. But at that moment, I thought it was discrimination, which is done by music company.
