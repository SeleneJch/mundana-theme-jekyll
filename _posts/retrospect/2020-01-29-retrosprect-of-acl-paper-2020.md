1. retrosprect of acl2020

- why i didn't choose cebuano?
there was no language choice except google translation. to my fault, i already consult my research, so after i knew the fact i should change the native speaker.
in the time i heard there was a political pressure in between LO so i felt i could do nothing in front of unbeatable, untouchable thing that even would never researched.

how can i say, meta-discrimination?

- music streaming service but, it was not available in korea, and i thought it is discrimination for the first time, but it was not. i realized i was in mood, and got afraid this kind of circumstance make me more blind

2. Retrospect of  university life

now I'm on my flight, about 10 hours, to the munich (technically, it's on Helsinky)
3 months ago, i got rejected to this academy for not that fluent,

a year ago I was writing my dissertation paper, on Pycon Korea Committe(contacting someone to plasirism), Semantic Role Label detection competition by Naver & Changwon Univ. There, first time i used npm. did the part time job (python tutoring, 수능 tutor)

2 years ago, I was with bomin, and doing 하청/외주 from W-surgery and got to know il-hyun. He and i still remind that day, that peaceful day, with no worries, just each other.

So, why am I here? how could i come to go munich, alone?

And, I, still wonder, is this what I want? in my life? am i self-decisive women?
