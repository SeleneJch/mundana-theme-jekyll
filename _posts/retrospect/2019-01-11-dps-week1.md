## Welcome to Digital Product School!

### Trip to Spitzingsee

At the first day of Digital Product School, we had a off-site with all of batch 9 people. All the costs were managed by dps. At the beautiful mountain, we settled the team, and got our team goal.
Basically, there are two kind of team in DPS. 

(1) Wild team - the team has fixed topic
(2) Company team - the team which has specific stakeholders, and also topic defined by that stakeholders

The Core-team will fix what tema you will join in DPS for 3 months based on your professionals, they announce it at off-site.

After that, we have a workshop for getting to know each other. For example, we share 1) what do I expect from 3 months of dps, 2) when I feel happy in my life time, 3) what I worked for last week, 4) what was my last project and 5) what plays important role in my life
