## Welcome to Digital Product School!

### Trip to Spitzingsee

- At the first day of Digital Product School, we had a off-site with all of batch 9 people.
All the costs were managed by dps. At the beautiful mountain, we settled the team, and got my team goal.

- Basically, there are two kind of team in DPS. 
(1) Wild team - the team has fixed topic
(2) Company team - the team which has specific stakeholders, and also topic defined by that stakeholders

The Core-team will fix what team you will join in DPS for 3 months based on ymy professionals, they announce it at off-site.

- And we decide on my batch #9 theme song. **How?** Each team draw for songs and pitch 'why this song should be batch #9 theme song'
**The result?** Imagine dragon - Believer (I didn't know at the moment, this song would be stamped in my memory)

- We have a workshop for getting to know each other.
For example, we share 1) what do I expect from 3 months of dps, 2) when I feel happy in my life time, 3) what I worked for last week, 4) what was my last project and 5) what plays important role in my life

- Now time to get to know my team's stakeholders.
*What they want for us? What they expect from us? How free my team are on the topic?*

To be honest, it is endless tug-of-war. We should discuss with my stakeholders, endlessly, and find out solution which can meet interest of users, stakeholders and my team.

Basically, my team's main stakeholder is [ADAC](https://www.adac.de/), but [BMW](), [City of munich]() and [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/) will also participate as my team's stakeholders.
