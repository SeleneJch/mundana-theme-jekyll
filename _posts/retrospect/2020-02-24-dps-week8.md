## Preparing engineering weekly

This week at Wednesday, I planned to explain the *Language Modelings*, mainly focusing ELMo, ULMFiT, BERT and GPT-2.<br />
Slides is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-oTUqgFq0x3N8QpcN7gHay5KhIN2KdFGOTxzujr75ck/edit?usp=sharing) 
Changed the presentation, because there were people who are not in ML domain. [here](https://www.slideshare.net/JiWenKim/applicable-bert)<br />
Whenever I do the presentation, I learn more than the information I give them. At the same time, I realize I need to learn more than I know. 

## Agile Process
One of a priceless lesson I learnt from digital product school, was experience of doing agile work. Before I came here, it was a little bit vague concept. I'm not sure 'what is agile' but this is what we tried to make agile process. <br />

### Daily Stand-up

Sharing the works everyday helps interdisciplinary team to work better. Since product started to get higher fidelity, the gap between engineer and non-engineer increased. Actually I didn't planned to explain concept because I thougth I would be lose my audience when I start to explain. But as daily stand-up, which shares our progess, goes day by day, I planed and reported the issues. And it made each other's topic feel more **familiar**. I think point is very important, because at that point people start to be curious. So we can actively ask to the others, and that momwnr, we can explain the point teammate dosen't know.

Each of us try to explain what we are doing, but things become easier when we are asked. Because we explained something was important to us before, but if we asked it is something important for the others.

## Making application flowchart (feat draw.io) /  ER diagram

![](/assets/images/week8/draw-io.png)

- Before we start the party, we should clarify the flowchart and ER diagram of our application.
- Thankfully, we could use draw.io for our flowchart framework. (It can be connected to GCP!)
    * Following basic of UML diagram was little bit difficult.
    * Flowchart has rule with the symbols, color, size, space, scaling and direction of arrow
    * [This tutorial](https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/flowchart-guide-flowchart-tutorial) helps us a lot to make conventional flowchart

### ER diagram

Even if we use NoSQL database through firebase, my team was accustomed to SQL more. That what we educated when we were at 


## Engineering weekly

Every engineering weekly we exchange our knowledge each other so that we can grow together.

Before today, my AI collegues presented `regression, knn` and it was my turn. I prepared slide that explain about [pre-trained language model](https://www.slideshare.net/JiWenKim/pre-trained-language-model), but my header advised me if I go deep of theoretical things, I would lose my audience. So I decided to brief [BERT mode](https://www.slideshare.net/JiWenKim/applicable-bert), how I can contribute to other team's project. Since BERT was breakthrough of NLP industry, I tried to explain how it can be applied to hands on product and how it can help people in their product.

The result was quite motivative to me. They gave feedback that since it wasn't that much theoretical, they could enjoy it, and useful information. Someone asked me do I had learned of presentation before. I was really happy with their feedback!
