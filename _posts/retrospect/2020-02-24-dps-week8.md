## Preparing engineering weekly

- This week at Wednesday, I will explain the *Language Modelings*, mainly focusing ELMo, ULMFiT, BERT and GPT-2.
Slides is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-oTUqgFq0x3N8QpcN7gHay5KhIN2KdFGOTxzujr75ck/edit?usp=sharing) 
- Changed the presentation, because there were people who are not in ML domain. [here](https://www.slideshare.net/JiWenKim/applicable-bert)

## Agile Process, daily stand-up
- As always, we did daily stand-up to follow-up our agile process.
This daily stand-up helps us to synchronize each part's process so that we can save our time when we have to explain our project in charge.

## Making application flowchart (feat draw.io)

![](/assets/images/week8/draw-io.png)

- Before we start the party, we should clarify the flowchart and ER diagram of our application.
- Thankfully, we could use draw.io for our flowchart framework. (It can be connected to GCP!)
    * Following basic of UML diagram was little bit difficult.
    * Flowchart has rule with the symbols, color, size, space, scaling and direction of arrow
    * [This tutorial](https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/flowchart-guide-flowchart-tutorial) helps us a lot to make conventional flowchart

## Engineering weekly

Every engineering weekly we exchange our knowledge each other so that we can grow together.

Before today, my AI collegues presented `regression, knn` and it was my turn. I prepared slide that explain about [pre-trained language model](https://www.slideshare.net/JiWenKim/pre-trained-language-model), but my header advised me if I go deep of theoretical things, I would lose my audience. So I decided to brief [BERT mode](https://www.slideshare.net/JiWenKim/applicable-bert), how I can contribute to other team's project. Since BERT was breakthrough of NLP industry, I tried to explain how it can be applied to hands on product and how it can help people in their product.

The result was quite motivative to me. They gave feedback that since it wasn't that much theoretical, they could enjoy it, and useful information. Someone asked me do I had learned of presentation before. I was really happy with their feedback!
