## Preparing engineering weekly

- This week at Wednesday, I will explain the *Language Modelings*, mainly focusing ELMo, ULMFiT, BERT and GPT-2.
Slides is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-oTUqgFq0x3N8QpcN7gHay5KhIN2KdFGOTxzujr75ck/edit?usp=sharing)

## Agile Process, daily stand-up
- As always, we did daily stand-up to follow-up our agile process.
This daily stand-up helps us to synchronize each part's process so that we can save our time when we have to explain our project in charge.

## Making application flowchart (feat draw.io)

![](/assets/images/week8/draw-io.png)

- Before we start the party, we should clarify the flowchart and ER diagram of our application.
- Thankfully, we could use draw.io for our flowchart framework. (It can be connected to GCP!)
	* Following basic of UML diagram was little bit difficult.
	* Flowchart has rule with the symbols, color, size, space, scaling and direction of arrow
	* [This tutorial](https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/flowchart-guide-flowchart-tutorial) helps us a lot to make conventional flowchart
