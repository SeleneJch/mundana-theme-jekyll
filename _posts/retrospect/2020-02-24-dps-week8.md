## Preparing engineering weekly

This week at Wednesday, I will explain the *Language Modelings*, mainly focusing ELMo, ULMFiT, BERT and GPT-2.<br />
Slides is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-oTUqgFq0x3N8QpcN7gHay5KhIN2KdFGOTxzujr75ck/edit?usp=sharing) 
Changed the presentation, because there were people who are not in ML domain. [here](https://www.slideshare.net/JiWenKim/applicable-bert)<br />
Whenever always I do the presentation, I learn more than I thought. Also I realize I need to learn more than I know, and sharing stuff I have is very exciting. 

## Agile Process, daily stand-up
One of valuable learning from dps, is I learned 'what is agile' work and how people do the work. Here is some reasons I personally realized doing agile work.
Sharing the works daily relaeases the discrepency between a team members. Even thought whole team member is not engineer, we have to explain every day what we are doing, every day we get to understand each other's work. We can leave other team members' work without wholly understaing their work but become being curious and start to understand each team members' work. Steadiness and variability were the key of understaing each other and also making job done effectively.<br />

we can make our weekly board, for example, changing the way section is divided. First we horizontal section was for each role, and vertical was status of jobs. And later, team felt content of board is too general so we changed it to daily (Mon-Fir). and again we felt board is little bit un-organized so it's little bit hard to understand what's going on in one glance, we changed again, horizontal as weekly goal vertical as status of job, color as each role and magnet as person in charge. Now we are little experienced of this process, so we could shorten the time from 30 min to 10 min. We can brifely update each one's job and follow-up what they did yesterday, what they will do today, and what issue they have at this moment.<br />

It is quite great and really helpful for making things done.

## Making application flowchart (feat draw.io)

![](/assets/images/week8/draw-io.png)

- Before we start the party, we should clarify the flowchart and ER diagram of our application.
- Thankfully, we could use draw.io for our flowchart framework. (It can be connected to GCP!)
    * Following basic of UML diagram was little bit difficult.
    * Flowchart has rule with the symbols, color, size, space, scaling and direction of arrow
    * [This tutorial](https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/flowchart-guide-flowchart-tutorial) helps us a lot to make conventional flowchart

## Engineering weekly

Every engineering weekly we exchange our knowledge each other so that we can grow together.

Before today, my AI collegues presented `regression, knn` and it was my turn. I prepared slide that explain about [pre-trained language model](https://www.slideshare.net/JiWenKim/pre-trained-language-model), but my header advised me if I go deep of theoretical things, I would lose my audience. So I decided to brief [BERT mode](https://www.slideshare.net/JiWenKim/applicable-bert), how I can contribute to other team's project. Since BERT was breakthrough of NLP industry, I tried to explain how it can be applied to hands on product and how it can help people in their product.

The result was quite motivative to me. They gave feedback that since it wasn't that much theoretical, they could enjoy it, and useful information. Someone asked me do I had learned of presentation before. I was really happy with their feedback!
