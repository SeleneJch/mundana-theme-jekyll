## How to create our story map

There was a Milestone workshop, about our weekly goal. As we are agile working, we go fast and change every week's goal. This week we will finalize our [story map](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033851.do) based on user's pain-point and HMW questions.

</div>

Basically we should make story map based on this rule

- *Tell stories, don’t just write them!*
	+ We always need context, that means all the story component should be connected
- *Visualize your product to establish a shared understanding and speed up discussions!*
	+ Post-it filled of text is not enough, we should fill it with visualizations then team mates can understand it fast 
- *Only discuss in front our your story map! (Speed)*
	+ So we can update our story-map as soon as we change our opinion
	+ And also 
- *Use a story map to find the parts that matter most and to identify holes in your idea!*
    + Since the story map consists of techinical part, we should consider each story's technical feasibility
- *Minimise output, maximise outcome and impact!*
- *Build tests to figure out what’s minimum and what’s viable!*
    + This story map functions to find out our minimum value of ideas
- *Work iteratively: Change your story map according to your learnings!*
    + We should repeat this process again and again
- *PMs: Make sure Storymap is up to date!*

## Prepare your story

What is your strategy to make user achieve something? This would be our expand point

## Discover your product's AI potential

*How can we apply AI to our product? Let's write down our 'HMW' questions, and find out all p ossibilities.* <br />
These are suggestion of possibilities, so don't attached to feasibility (we will do in at lean start-up)
