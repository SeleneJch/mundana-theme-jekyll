### A. 

(1) Gradable antonym: ***more or less*** relation

- ex) beautiful/ugly, expensive/cheap, hot/cold
- comparable

(2) contradictory / complementary antonym: ***either or not*** relation

- ex) awake/asleep, dead/alive, on/off, true/false
- The assertion of one implies the denial of the other member of the pair 

(3) converse: one expresses the converse meaning of the other

- ex) above/below, before/after, buy/sell, give/receive, woman/man
- reverse of an individual feature of a word give us the other member of the pair
