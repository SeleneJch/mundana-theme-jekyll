"Humans are no longer valued for our creativity.<br />
Now we are just valued for our data"[^1]<br />

It does require specific conditions that people are living in the competitive.<br />

I think, no doubt, It's a supercompetitive world.<br />

*After watching this vedio, I remembered meeting an acountant partner at a Big 4 firm, 3 years ago.*{::}<br />
I met him via mentoring system in university, so the acountant partner encouraged me to be a acountant, because they rate SNU highly.<br />
Besides, the acountant said, to be frankly said, what neighborhood & school(even high school), where they are living now(commute time!) and single or married are more liable than anything.<br />

> Well You know, those values are relatively objective than cover letter or your apperance... anything.

When I left his firm, after mentoring, he happened a junior staff.

"She is married women and graduated from just that schoo. But her performance quite good. Outlier."

And the acountant's word, which I've heard 3 years ago, coincides in "Digital Future"[^2] that regard creativity creates noise.
