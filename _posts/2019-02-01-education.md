##New year, new challenges

So, this year started with me relocating to a different city and living abroad for the first time. I wanted a change of places and faces and it happened that i got accepted in this program I applied to a while back. and since I was on a break and didn't apply for any new jobs, I decided to take it and explore a little bit the startup ecosystem in Munich. and here I am in Munich with new plans and goals for this upcoming 3 months.
