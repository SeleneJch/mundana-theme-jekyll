### How did I come to that repository?

When I'm stuck, I would prefer to code, than to go deep in theory. (It must be so.. too much to understand ðŸ¤’)&nbsp;
It was [BERT released by Google AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) I felt keenly the necessity of implementing, because not only couldn't understand the way they figured out positional encoding formula, but how it actually works.&nbsp;What does it mean to "scale" dot product in Attention? (Now I know it's far from my section ðŸ˜‚)&nbsp;

### What was the code error?

For implement code in paper, I read the papers [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf), structured the model, and refered the others' code.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Meanwhile, I found out a small error in tokenization process, which was changing a token into [MASK], enabled bidirectional representation.

### I've made PR, and got merged. But I was not in contributors. Why?

Actually I happened to know I was exception, after that I became curious.&nbsp;
So... Doesn't it means we can cover up someone's traces?&nbsp;
Did I something wrong?&nbsp;

According to [About pull request merges](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges) and [git](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_fast_forward_merge), it's because a person who has a write permission had selected squash (fast-forward) merge option on a pull request.&nbsp;
Since it dose fetch from the remote first and immediately execute <code>git merge</code> to create a merge commit, this option append a commit to master without creating a commit.
