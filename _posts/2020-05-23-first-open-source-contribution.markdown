# How did it start? 

After working for a while on my own iOS projects, I wanted to try working on bigger ones. I have always had contributing to open source big codebases on my list but there was always a reason for me to push it for later thinking it will need a lot of time or I'm not good enough for it or ready. In college, I wanted to apply to GSoC but eventually ended up not doing it (which I regret now), after following alot of code bases and people who are contribuiting to open source code and gaining some confidence to go for it I came across a program for open source contribtuion online while browsing and this is where it all started.

The program is called Outreachy and the whole purpose of it is to encourage more people to kick off their open source journies and pick a project that they contribute to for 3 months. The good think about Outreachy as well, is that they are really inclusive and they stress in every occassion on the importance of building a supportive community that's open for all and that encourages underepresented individuals in tech to participate. 

The projects that took part in the program were very interesting and they were sophisticated enough for you to enhance your skills and learn while building them but at the same time there were enough projects for different levels of expertise for everyone to pick. The companies and institutions who took part were big to mention some : Apache, Mozilla, CC, Wikimedia, Fedora and Tor and various other recognizable entites in the open source community.

Since I've recently been coding in Swift and Python, I searched for the related projects written in both and decided to pick Mozilla's Firefox as my first open source project to contribute to. 
First, because it was a big project, so I would learn alot while working on it and getting used to working with alot of files and code components. Second, because it's an app that's different than the apps I worked on, it's a browser app with alot of functionality to build in different components.

my first encounter with the code was a bit overwhelming, I picked one of the simple issues first to work on untill I get more familiar with the code, but even this simple issue was hard to work on at first, not because technical complexity but because the code was too big, I couldn't find the designated part where I should edit :D

after navigating through the code and reading different classes and their purpose, I got a grip around it and could fix my first issue which was a UI issue. but I gained alot regarding the code base as I got used to it and knew which parts were related to which components of the app. skimming through the code more than once can have benefits :D 

My friends where xcode's search and documentation browsing (option button + choose the keyword) to jump to definitions and different classes.

One trick while working with firefox project though and if it's a UI fix or a functionality that has related UI, is that you can search for the relevant code component searching by the UI element related to it. 

my first issue was this
