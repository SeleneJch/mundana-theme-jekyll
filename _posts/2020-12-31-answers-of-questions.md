## Linguistics

### Q. Types of antonym 

studying augmentation like `rotate, flip, lighten`, why there is no option like darkening? -> type of antonym

related keywords: Semantics, Sematic fields(= meaning relations), Componential analysis [^1]

### A. 

(1) Gradable antonym: ***more or less*** relation

- ex) beautiful/ugly, expensive/cheap, hot/cold
- comparable

(2) contradictory / complementary antonym: ***either or not*** relation

- ex) awake/asleep, dead/alive, on/off, true/false
- The assertion of one implies the denial of the other member of the pair 

(3) converse: one expresses the converse meaning of the other

- ex) above/below, before/after, buy/sell, give/receive, woman/man
- reverse of an individual feature of a word give us the other member of the pair


### Q. What is the meaning of `a saturated neural network`

### A.

When the nonlinearity function gets the value near its boundary.<br/>
In this case, gradients are small so that we change little of the input.<br/>
-> This would not be a big deal if neurons are correct<br/>
-> but in other cases, this gives us a big problem.[^2]
