<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Before now, me as a undergraduate student, I was parsimony who usually depend on colab, kaggle, friendâ€™s server(occasional) whenever i need GPU..<br />
<br />
And this time itâ€™s been for a while to install GPU than I expected and I share the several component that stood in my way.<br />
<br />

<p>Just for the record, Iâ€™ve used Kaggle, Colab, GCP, Azure, EC2 as GPU cloud.
<br /><br /></p>

<h3 id="1-did-not-know-there-is-jupyterlab-option-in-google-cloud-platform">1. Did not know there is <em>JupyterLab</em> option in <strong>Google Cloud Platform</strong>.</h3>

<p>At the first time when GCP came out, there was no <strong>AI  Platform</strong> service. So from starting vm instance to launching jupyter and installing packages, I did all of the things myself. (and I learned ðŸ¤—)</p>

<p align="center">[Downloading conda in ssh]</p>

<p>I created VM instance,selected zone, machine type and disk type. Then, define firewall rules and in ssh terminal, install jupyter and other packages.<br /></p>

<p>But you can do all of these things just using AI Platform.<br /></p>

<p>I think it especially save your time if you are living in Asia-Pacific, which google doesnâ€™t support not that much GPU resources.</p>

<p><br />
I live in <em>South Korea, East Asia</em>, and it seems like this region has lots of limitation in GPU (except quite expensive AWS)<br /></p>

<p>And the Taiwan which was the only one region where I can launch my own VM with GPU (I tried all the other regions in the list) sometimes do normaly, but not always. ðŸ˜¥<br />
After launching, I did several works and next day I could not start VM. (I didnâ€™t count it, but tried it a few hours because I didnâ€™t want cost any more timeâ€¦)</p>

<p><br />
Endlessly failed to start instance, then I choose to move AWS as an alternative way.</p>

<p>Fast.ai offer the guide for all available platform. (Colab, salamander, Gradient, Kaggle, Colab, and so on)<br /></p>

<p>It is so important, and really needs, because cloud computing options are vary as occasion and purpose arise.<br /></p>

<p>I didnâ€™t know fast.ai has manual to running GCP, and I think itâ€™s as good a reason as any for me to be have taken time.<br /></p>

<p>It helped me so much when I had aws and shortened my time.<br /></p>

<p>I donâ€™t want to read all of the manual in amazno.. (It is recommended.. but Iâ€™d rather read <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">GIT PRO</a> nowâ€¦)</p>

<h3 id="4-you-should-wait-to-add-more-volume-just-after-add-volume-by-building-aws-ec2">4. You should wait to add more volume just after add volume, by building AWS EC2.</h3>

<p>Since Elastic Block Store(EBS) storage supports optimized storage, users canâ€™t extend storage volume two times in a row. <br /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, at the first time, I didnâ€™t know it (again ðŸ‘») and when VM lacked volume, I doubled dist capacity (76*2) at a rough but It needs more. <br /></p>

<p>&lt;!â€“</p>

<p>this time I installed GPU in two years, and it became little complicated compared to 2 years ago.
And this time for the first time(maybe not the first time.. but i handled it in my class or with my friend. but itâ€™s my first time on my own.) I 
very Iâ€™m started to using used google colab, kaggle
and, GCP-JupyterLab, ec2 - friend made, 
aws vm machine but I had a environment variable but i did not know of it.
On these days, I could not get a resources from taiwanâ€¦</p>

    <p>I couldnâ€™t notice a deliberate</p>
  </li>

    <p>Anyway, as a result I tried myself gcp myself and aws ec2 with fast.ai But I think doing on my self surely takes much time (in this point I wonder why Iâ€™m doing this, and should remind me, especially I was studying disk volume optimization)</p>
