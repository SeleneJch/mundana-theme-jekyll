<p>There was a Milestone workshop, about our weekly goal. As we are agile working, we go fast and change every week’s goal. This week we will finalize our <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033851.do">story map</a> based on user’s pain-point and HMW questions.</p>

    <figcaption>How should we make our story-map</figcaption>    
</div>

<p>Basically we should make story map based on this rule</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Tell stories, don’t just write them!</em>
    <ul>
      <li>We always need context, that means all the story component should be connected</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Visualize your product to establish a shared understanding and speed up discussions!</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Post-it filled of text is not enough, we should fill it with visualizations then team mates can understand it fast</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Only discuss in front our your story map! (Speed)</em>
    <ul>
      <li>So we can update our story-map as soon as we change our opinion</li>
      <li>And also</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Use a story map to find the parts that matter most and to identify holes in your idea!</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Since the story map consists of techinical part, we should consider each story’s technical feasibility</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Minimise output, maximise outcome and impact!</em></li>
  <li><em>Build tests to figure out what’s minimum and what’s viable!</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This story map functions to find out our minimum value of ideas</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Work iteratively: Change your story map according to your learnings!</em>
    <ul>
      <li>We should repeat this process again and again</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>PMs: Make sure Storymap is up to date!</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>How can we apply AI to our product? Let’s write down our ‘HMW’ questions, and find out all p ossibilities.</em> <br />
These are suggestion of possibilities, so don’t attached to feasibility (we will do in at lean start-up)</p>
