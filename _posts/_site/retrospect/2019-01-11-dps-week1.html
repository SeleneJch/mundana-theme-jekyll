<ul>
  <li>
    <p>At the first day of Digital Product School, we had a off-site with all of batch 9 people.
All the costs were managed by dps. At the beautiful mountain, we settled the team, and got my team goal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically, there are two kind of team in DPS. 
(1) Wild team - the team has fixed topic
(2) Company team - the team which has specific stakeholders, and also topic defined by that stakeholders</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Core-team will fix what team you will join in DPS for 3 months based on ymy professionals, they announce it at off-site.</p>

[My team for 3 months at DPS]</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>And we decide on my batch #9 theme song. <strong>How?</strong> Each team draw for songs and pitch ‘why this song should be batch #9 theme song’
<strong>The result?</strong> Imagine dragon - Believer (I didn’t know at the moment, this song would be stamped in my memory)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a workshop for getting to know each other.
For example, we share 1) what do I expect from 3 months of dps, 2) when I feel happy in my life time, 3) what I worked for last week, 4) what was my last project and 5) what plays important role in my life</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Now time to get to know my team’s stakeholders.
<em>What they want for us? What they expect from us? How free my team are on the topic?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>To be honest, it is endless tug-of-war. We should discuss with my stakeholders, endlessly, and find out solution which can meet interest of users, stakeholders and my team.</p>

<p>Basically, my team’s main stakeholder is <a href="https://www.adac.de/">ADAC</a>, but <a href="">BMW</a>, <a href="">City of munich</a> and <a href="https://www.nokia.com/">Nokia</a> will also participate as my team’s stakeholders.</p>
