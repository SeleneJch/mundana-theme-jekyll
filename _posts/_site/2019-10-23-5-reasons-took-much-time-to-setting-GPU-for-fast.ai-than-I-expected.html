<p>Before now, me as a undergraduate student, I was parsimony who usually depend on colab, kaggle, friend’s server(occasional) whenever i need GPU.. 
 
And this time it’s been for a while to install GPU than I expected and I share the several component that stood in my way.

<p>At the first time when GCP came out, there was no <strong>AI  Platform</strong> service. So from starting vm instance to launching jupyter and installing packages, I did all of the things myself. (but I learned 🤗)</p>

<p> 
I created VM instance,selected zone, machine type and disk type. Then, define firewall rules and in ssh terminal, install jupyter and other packages.</p>

<p>But you can do all of these things AI Platform.</p>

<p>I think if you are at Asia-Pacific, it can save your time.</p>

<p> 
I live in <em>South Korea, East Asia</em>, and it seems like this region has lots of limitation in GPU (except quite expensive AWS).</p>

<p> 
And the Taiwan which was the only one region where I can launch my own VM with GPU (I tried all the other regions in the list) sometimes do normaly, but not always. 😥</p>

<p> 
After launching, I did several works and next day I could not start VM. (I didn’t count it, but tried it a few hours because I didn’t want cost any more time…)</p>

<p> 
Endlessly failed to start instance, then I choose to move AWS as an alternative way.</p>

<p> 
Fast.ai offer the guide for all available platform. (Colab, salamander, Gradient, Kaggle, Colab, and so on)</p>

<p> 
It is so important, and really needs, because cloud computing options are vary as occasion and purpose arise.</p>

<p> 
I didn’t know fast.ai has manual to running GCP, and I think it’s as good a reason as any for me to be have taken time.</p>

<p> 
It helped me so much when I had aws and shortened time.</p>

<p>I don’t want to read all of the manual in amazno.. (It is recommended.. but I’d rather read <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">GIT PRO</a> for now…)
<code>ssh -i ~/.ssh/<your_private_key_pair> -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 ubuntu@<your instance="" IP="">&lt;/code&gt;</your></your_private_key_pair></code></p>

<p> 
Since Elastic Block Store(EBS) storage supports optimized storage, users can’t extend storage volume two times in a row.</p>

<p> 
Unfortunately, at the first time, I didn’t know it (again 👻) and when VM lacked volume, I doubled dist capacity (76*2) at a rough but It needs more.</p>

<p> </p>

<!--# TODO

그냥 더 추가하면 되겠지라고생각했으나 optimizing 중입니다.. 안됩니다 라고 했따 ㅠ
맨 위에 내가 뭘 뭘 해봤던 사람인지  적기. 저기 적힌 것중엔 Kaggle, Golab, google colud, Azure, amazon ec2가 있군.-->

<p>this time I installed GPU in two years, and it became little complicated compared to 2 years ago.
And this time for the first time(maybe not the first time.. but i handled it in my class or with my friend. but it’s my first time on my own.) I 
very I’m started to using used google colab, kaggle
and, GCP-JupyterLab, ec2 - friend made, 
aws vm machine but I had a environment variable but i did not know of it.
On these days, I could not get a resources from taiwan…</p>

  <li>
    <p>I couldn’t notice a deliberate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyway, as a result I tried myself gcp myself and aws ec2 with fast.ai But I think doing on my self surely takes much time (in this point I wonder why I’m doing this, and should remind me, especially I was studying disk volume optimization)</p>
