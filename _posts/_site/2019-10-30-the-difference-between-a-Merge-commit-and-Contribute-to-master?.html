<p>When I’m stuck, I would prefer to code, than to go deep in theory. (It must be so.. too much to understand 🤒) 
It was <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf">BERT released by Google AI</a> I felt keenly the necessity of implementing, because not only couldn’t understand the way they figured out positional encoding formula, but how it actually works. What does it mean to “scale” dot product in Attention? (Now I know it’s far from my section 😂) </p>

<h3 id="what-was-the-code-error">What was the code error?</h3>

<p>For implement code in paper, I read the papers <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf">Transformer</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf">BERT</a>, structured the model, and refered the others’ code.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, I found out a small error in tokenization process, which was changing a token into [MASK], enabled bidirectional representation.</p>

<p>Actually I happened to know I was exception, after that I became curious. 
So… Doesn’t it means we can cover up someone’s traces? 
Did I something wrong? </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges">About pull request merges</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_fast_forward_merge">git</a>, it’s because a person who has a write permission had selected squash (fast-forward) merge option on a pull request. 
Since it dose fetch from the remote first and immediately execute <code>git merge</code> to create a merge commit, this option append a commit to master without creating a commit.</p>
