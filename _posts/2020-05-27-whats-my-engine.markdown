# Core Values

As part of participating in Outreachy, which is a program for open source contribution that I'm gladly taking part of this summer, We were asked a question regarding our core values.

I know that I have some inner compass that guide me while taking my life decesions, but I never put much thought into defining it, I know it exists and it just does the job whenever I need it.

So, faced by this question, I had to think about the most values that matter to me in life or career and explain why. I remembered that during my time in Munich at Digital Product School we had a workshop for core values, at first when I saw it on my schedule I thought : pfft!, this is just another team building activity. but then after the workshop has ended I realized how important it is to define these values so they act as a reminder for you during your journey and push you forward. 

Before speaking about my 4 core values, I will share what we did in the exercise, because it wasn't just about defining our values but also how these values are balanced when we work with a team.

In this photo, an example core value was **Quietness**. When you think about a value, first think about this value exaggerated negatively and what this might entail. for quietness..
