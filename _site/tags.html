And I couldn't be happier. &nbsp;	If for some reason you want to reward my work, I'd feel really appreciated. You would help me tremendously!	and the blog is not actually, I'm not good at design.  &nbsp; And I also belive in open source and it’s a great template, I gave him a token of my gratitude.

Foundation version: 2. 3 Gradients backward pass:  Gradients is output with respect to parameter we’ve done this work in this path(below)  to simplify this calculus, we can just change it into,  So, you should know of the derivative of each bit on its own, and then you multiply them all together. As a result, it would be $$dydx$$ cross over the data.  So you can get gradient, output with respect to parameter  What order should we calculate? BTW, why Jeremy wrote , not Loss function?1 decompose function We want to get derivative of which forms  But, we have a estimation of answer (we call it y hat) now So, I will decompose funciton to trace target variable.  Using the above forward pass, we can suppose some function from the end.  start from , We know MSE funciton got two parameters, output, and target .  from MSE’s input we know function’s output and supposing v is input of that function,  similarly, v became output of chain rule with code   examplify backward process by random sampling     To get a variable, I modified forward model a little  def model_ping(out = 'x_train'):  l1 = lin(x_train, w1, b1) # one linear layer  l2 = relu(l1) # one relu layer  l3 = lin(l2, w2, b2) # one more linear layer  return eval(out) Be careful we don’t use mse_loss in backward process1) start with the very last function, which is loss funciton. MSE  If we codify this formula,def mse_grad(inp, targ): #mse_input(1000,1), mse_targ (1000,1)  # grad of loss with respect to output of previous layer  inp. g = 2. * (inp. squeeze() - targ). unsqueeze(-1) / inp. shape[0] And, this can be examplified like below.  Notice that input of gradient function is same with forward functiony_hat = model_ping('l3') #get value from forward modely_hat. g = ((y_hat. squeeze(-1)-y_train). unsqueeze(-1))/y_hat. shape[0]y_hat. g. shape&gt;&gt;&gt; torch. Size([50000, 1]) We can just calculate using broadcasting, not using squeeze. then why should do and unsqueeze again?🎯 It’s related with random access memory(RAM). . If I don’t squeeze, (I’m using colab) it out of RAM. 2) Derivative of linear2 function def lin_grad(inp, out, w, b):  # grad of matmul with respect to input  inp. g = out. g @ w. t()  w. g = (inp. unsqueeze(-1) * out. g. unsqueeze(1)). sum(0)  b. g = out. g. sum(0) Examplified belowlin2 = model_ping('l2'); #get value from forward modellin2. g = y_hat. g@w2. t(); w2. g = (lin2. unsqueeze(-1) * y_hat. g. unsqueeze(1)). sum(0);b2. g = y_hat. g. sum(0);lin2. g. shape, w2. g. shape, b2. g. shape&gt;&gt;&gt; torch.

You should not standarlize validation set because training set and validation set should be aparted.  after normalize, mean is close to zero, and standard deviation is close to 1. 1. 2 Variable definition:  n,m: size of the training set c: the number of activations we need in our model2. Foundation Version: 2. 1 Basic architecture:  Our model has one hidden layer, output to have 10 activations, used in cross entropy.

We do not calculate each component. But all of the component at once. Because, length of column of A and row of B are fixed.   How much time we saved?  So now that takes 1. 37ms. We have removed one line of code and it is a 178 times faster…#TODOI don’t know where the 5 from. but keep it.

But I was not in contributors. Why?: Figure 2. Merged Pull request Adopted from graykode projectActually I happened to know there can be couple of reasons github doesn’t include my name as contributor. Well, if contributors tab has more than 100 people, in which case it shows you up only if you are in the top 100 contributors because displaying too many contributors can make webpages down. Somethimes, however, it doesn’t that problem. Why not? Two possibilities are there.    First, According to Joel-Glovier, if repository maintainer merged-as-a-rebase PR will end up showing as maintainer’s commit. But maintainer shouldn’t normally do this.     Second, if you happend to commit using a different git email that what is in your GitHub profile, it will not be attached to your Github user, and “doesn’t show up” as you.

I think it’s a pity that mainstream political theory pays very little attention to emotions.     Oftentimes, analysts and experts are so busy with data and metrics that they seem to forget those things in life that are difficult to measure and perhaps impossible to cluster under statistical models. But I think this is a mistake, for two main reasons. We are emotional beings.     I think it’s going to be one of our biggest intellectual challenges, because our political systems are replete with emotions. In country after country, we have seen illiberal politicians exploiting these emotions. And yet within the academia and among the intelligentsia, we are yet to take emotions seriously.

    "body": "2019/10/23 - Motivation: Before now, me as a undergraduate student, I was parsimony who usually depend on colab, kaggle, friend’s server(occasional) whenever i need GPU. . And this time it’s been for a while to install GPU than I expected and I share the several component that stood in my way. Written at Oct 24 2019, if you think this is deprecated, please do not have a leap of faith. Just for the record, I’ve used Kaggle, Colab, GCP, Azure, EC2 as GPU cloud. 1. Did not know there is JupyterLab option in Google Cloud Platform. : At the first time when GCP came out, there was no AI Platform service. So from starting vm instance to launching jupyter and installing packages, I did all of the things myself. (and I learned 🤗) $	curl -O https://repo. continuum. io/archive/Anaconda3-5. 0. 1-Linux-x86_64. sh[Downloading conda in ssh] I created VM instance,selected zone, machine type and disk type. Then, define firewall rules and in ssh terminal, install jupyter and other packages. But you can do all of these things just using AI Platform.  [AI Platform] I think it especially save your time if you are living in Asia-Pacific, which google doesn’t support not that much GPU resources.  2. Consider if the platform has limited resources in a region you live in. : I live in South Korea, East Asia, and it seems like this region has lots of limitation in GPU (except quite expensive AWS) And the Taiwan which was the only one region where I can launch my own VM with GPU (I tried all the other regions in the list) sometimes do normaly, but not always. 😥After launching, I did several works and next day I could not start VM. (I didn’t count it, but tried it a few hours because I didn’t want cost any more time…) Endlessly failed to start instance, then I choose to move AWS as an alternative way. 3. Fast. ai gives deliberate guide and I didn’t know it. : Fast. ai offer the guide for all available platform. (Colab, salamander, Gradient, Kaggle, Colab, and so on) It is so important, and really needs, because cloud computing options are vary as occasion and purpose arise. I didn’t know fast. ai has manual to running GCP, and I think it’s as good a reason as any for me to be have taken time. It helped me so much when I had aws and shortened my time. I don’t want to read all of the manual in amazno. . (It is recommended. . but I’d rather read GIT PRO now…) ssh -i ~/. ssh/&lt;your_private_key_pair&gt; -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 ubuntu@&lt;your instance IP&gt;4. You should wait to add more volume just after add volume, by building AWS EC2. : Since Elastic Block Store(EBS) storage supports optimized storage, users can’t extend storage volume two times in a row.  Unfortunately, at the first time, I didn’t know it (again 👻) and when VM lacked volume, I doubled dist capacity (76*2) at a rough but It needs more.  &lt;!– this time I installed GPU in two years, and it became little complicated compared to 2 years ago. And this time for the first time(maybe not the first time. . but i handled it in my class or with my friend. but it’s my first time on my own. ) I very I’m started to using used google colab, kaggleand, GCP-JupyterLab, ec2 - friend made, aws vm machine but I had a environment variable but i did not know of it. On these days, I could not get a resources from taiwan…    I couldn’t notice a deliberate     Anyway, as a result I tried myself gcp myself and aws ec2 with fast. ai But I think doing on my self surely takes much time (in this point I wonder why I’m doing this, and should remind me, especially I was studying disk volume optimization)     disk volume exceed - https://askubuntu. com/questions/919748/no-space-left-on-device-even-though-there-is:  "

What is that?read and run the code in a notebook, and in the process, Jeremy made Python Fire library called!shockingly, fire takes any kind of function and converts into CLI command. fire library was released by Google open source, Thursday, March 2, 2017    Get data   pytorch and numpy are pretty much same.  variable c explains how many pixels there are in in MNIST, 28 pixels PyTorch’s view() method: torch function that manipulating tensor, and squeeze() in torch &amp; mathmatical operation similar function Rao &amp; McMahan said usually this functions result in feature vector.    In part 1, you can use view function several times.     Initial python model     Which is Linear, like $Xw$(weight)$+a$(bias) $= Y$     If you don’t know hou to multiple matrix, refer this site matmul visulization site   How many time spends if we we use pure python   function matmul, typical matrix multiplication function, takes about 1 second for calculating 1 single train data! (maybe assumed stochastic, 5 data points in validation)     it takes about 11. 36 hours to update parameters even single layer and 1 iteration! (if that was my computer, it would be 14 hours. . )🤪   THIS is why we need to consider ‘time’&amp;’space’ This is kinda slow - what if we could speed it up by 50,000 times? Let’s try! Elementwise ops: How can we make python faster?:  If we want to calculate faster, then do remove pythonic calcuation, by passing its computation down to something that is written something other than python, like pytorch.  According to PyTorch doc it uses C++ (via ATen), so we are going to implement that function with python.

Different sources of bias have different causes Representation Bias: Dataset was not representative of the algorithm that might be used on later. Above : Data is okay, but algorithm has some problem. Below : Data has error.  For example, object detection production that performs very well in common product of US. But in contrast, change of target product region, like Zimbabwe, Solomon Island, and so on, reduced the performence remarkably. It is not the algorithmic problem, so we should care about data volume of region. Evaluation Bias: Benchmark datasets spur on research, 4. 4% of IJB-A images are dark-skinned women. 2/3 of ImageNet images from the West (Sharkar et al, 2017) Case Study 2: Recidivism Algorithm Used Prison Sentencing: Case Study 3: Online Ad Delivery: Bias in NLP: ( Nothing to do with the course, but I’m researching this field these days. )    But all about Englsih     ImpactThe person is doctor.

Concept of “biased data” often too generic to be useful:  Different sources of bias have different sources Data, models and systems are not unchanging numbers on a screen. They’re the result of a complex process that starts with years of historical context and involves a series of choices and norms, from data measurement to model evaluation to human interpretation. - Harini Suresh, “The problem with Biased Data” Five Sources of Bias in ML:  Representation Bias Evaluation Bias Measurement Bias Aggregation Bias(46:02) Historical Bias(46:26)     A few studies(47:13)   Racial Bias, Even when we have good intentions(new york times)(47:10)   gender(48:59)   Humans are biased, so why does algorithmic bias matter?: Algorithms &amp; humans are used differently (humans are usually decision maker):  Algorithms are accurate and objective No way to apeal if there if error processed large scale cheap Machine learning can amplify bias: Machine learning can create feedback loops. : Technology is power.
