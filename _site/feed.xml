&lt;p&gt;Before now, me as a undergraduate student, I was parsimony who usually depend on colab, kaggle, friend’s server(occasional) whenever i need GPU.. 
 
And this time it’s been for a while to install GPU than I expected and I share the several component that stood in my way.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-did-not-know-there-is-jupyterlab-in-google-cloud-platform&quot;&gt;1. Did not know there is &lt;em&gt;JupyterLab&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Google Cloud Platform&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the first time when GCP came out, there was no &lt;strong&gt;AI  Platform&lt;/strong&gt; service. So from starting vm instance to launching jupyter and installing packages, I did all of the things myself. (but I learned 🤗)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/why-it-took-so-much/installing-conda-cli.png&quot; alt=&quot;installing-conda-cli&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[Downloading conda in ssh]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
I created VM instance,selected zone, machine type and disk type. Then, define firewall rules and in ssh terminal, install jupyter and other packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can do all of these things AI Platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/why-it-took-so-much/AI.png&quot; alt=&quot;installing-conda-cli&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[AI Platform]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think if you are at Asia-Pacific, it can save your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-consider-if-the-platform-has-limited-resources-in-a-region-you-live-in&quot;&gt;2. Consider if the platform has limited resources in a region you live in.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
I live in &lt;em&gt;South Korea, East Asia&lt;/em&gt;, and it seems like this region has lots of limitation in GPU (except quite expensive AWS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
And the Taiwan which was the only one region where I can launch my own VM with GPU (I tried all the other regions in the list) sometimes do normaly, but not always. 😥&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
After launching, I did several works and next day I could not start VM. (I didn’t count it, but tried it a few hours because I didn’t want cost any more time…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
Endlessly failed to start instance, then I choose to move AWS as an alternative way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-fastai-gives-deliberate-guide-and-i-didnt-know-it&quot;&gt;3. &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Fast.ai gives deliberate &lt;a href=&quot;https://course.fast.ai/start_gcp.html&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; and I didn’t know it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
Fast.ai offer the guide for all available platform. (Colab, salamander, Gradient, Kaggle, Colab, and so on)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
It is so important, and really needs, because cloud computing options are vary as occasion and purpose arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
I didn’t know fast.ai has manual to running GCP, and I think it’s as good a reason as any for me to be have taken time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
It helped me so much when I had aws and shortened time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-you-should-wait-to-add-more-volume-just-after-add-volume-by-building-aws-ec2&quot;&gt;4. You should wait to add more volume just after add volume, by building AWS EC2.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
Since Elastic Block Store(EBS) storage supports optimized storage, users can’t extend storage volume two times in a row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
Unfortunately, at the first time, I didn’t know it (again 👻) and when VM lacked volume, I doubled dist capacity (76*2) at a rough but It needs more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--# TODO

그냥 더 추가하면 되겠지라고생각했으나 optimizing 중입니다.. 안됩니다 라고 했따 ㅠ
맨 위에 내가 뭘 뭘 해봤던 사람인지  적기. 저기 적힌 것중엔 Kaggle, Golab, google colud, Azure, amazon ec2가 있군.--&gt;

&lt;!--

this time I installed GPU in two years, and it became little complicated compared to 2 years ago.
And this time for the first time(maybe not the first time.. but i handled it in my class or with my friend. but it's my first time on my own.) I 
very I'm started to using used google colab, kaggle
and, GCP-JupyterLab, ec2 - friend made, 
aws vm machine but I had a environment variable but i did not know of it.
On these days, I could not get a resources from taiwan... 

3. I couldn't notice a deliberate 

4. Anyway, as a result I tried myself gcp myself and aws ec2 with fast.ai But I think doing on my self surely takes much time (in this point I wonder why I'm doing this, and should remind me, especially I was studying disk volume optimization)

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-formatting&quot;&gt;Special formatting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;strike through&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;==highlight==&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;*escaped characters*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-code-blocks&quot;&gt;Writing code blocks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/code&gt;. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reference-lists&quot;&gt;Reference lists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quick brown jumped over the lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;full-html&quot;&gt;Full HTML&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jane</name></author><category term="summer" /><summary type="html">There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor.

Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sal</name></author><category term="featured" /><summary type="html">The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet.

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-formatting&quot;&gt;Special formatting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;strike through&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;==highlight==&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;*escaped characters*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-code-blocks&quot;&gt;Writing code blocks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/code&gt;. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reference-lists&quot;&gt;Reference lists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quick brown jumped over the lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;full-html&quot;&gt;Full HTML&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dionne</name></author><summary type="html">There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/3.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Accumulated experience of social living</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/01/acumulated-experience/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Accumulated experience of social living" /><published>2019-01-30T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2019-01-30T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/01/acumulated-experience</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/01/acumulated-experience/">&lt;p&gt;The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes.&lt;/p&gt;

You only need to install it once - not every time you create a new Jekyll project. Here are some additional details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundler&lt;/code&gt; is a gem that manages other Ruby gems. It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gemfile.lock&lt;/code&gt; files inform &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/code&gt; about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec&lt;/code&gt; and just &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;run jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/code&gt; uses the gems and versions as specified in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gemfile.lock&lt;/code&gt; to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about how to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/code&gt; in your Jekyll project, this tutorial should provide answers to the most common questions and explain how to get up and running quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sal</name></author><summary type="html">gem install bundler installs the bundler gem through RubyGems.

As I engage in the so-called “bull sessions” around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education. Most of the “brethren” think that &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;education should equip&lt;/a&gt; them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jane</name></author><category term="featured" /><summary type="html">This is changed.
