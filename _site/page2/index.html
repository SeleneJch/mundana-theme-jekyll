(#f) weight decay means adding some valud to the gradients, so that it makes more shallow and less bumpy loss. Be cautious, when you do statistical model, they lessen the parameter to evade overfitting but modern machine learning doesn’t do that, and add regularization Creating our own Embedding module: Embedding is just indexing into an array Normally layer is made from inhertancing of module when you call torch and make tensor, they doesn’t have parameter, and you should define it using nn. parameter def create_params(size):  return nn. Parameter(torch. zeros(*size). normal_(0, 0. 01))class DotProductBias(Module):  def __init__(self, n_users, n_movies, n_factors, y_range=(0,5. 5)):    self. user_factors = create_params([n_users, n_factors])    self. user_bias = create_params([n_users])    self. movie_factors = create_params([n_movies, n_factors])    self. movie_bias = create_params([n_movies])    self. y_range = y_range      def forward(self, x):    users = self. user_factors[x[:,0]]    movies = self. movie_factors[x[:,1]]    res = (users*movies). sum(dim=1)    res += self. user_bias[x[:,0]] + self. movie_bias[x[:,1]]    return sigmoid_range(res, *self. y_range)pytorch has autograd so that we don’t have to calculate gradient manually  What’s our advantage making our own embedding instead of using pytorch oneJ: no advantage just implementing by yourself and easily learn concept. Interpreting embeddings and biases: movie_bias = learn. model. movie_bias. squeeze()idxs = movie_bias. argsort()[:5][dls. classes['title'][i] for i in idxs]meaning of this, not just (#f) we can use pca, and filter factors to 3, so we can select some kind of latent factors. 1 Using fastai. collab: learn = collab_learner(dls, n_factors=50, y_range=(0, 5. 5))learn. fit_one_cycle(5, 5e-3, wd=0. 1)you can get similar results using fastai Embedding distance: Distance between two movies. Let’s pick some movie and find distance, form one movie to every other movies. (#f)  (#f) J: visualization part is just what’s going in and. . ? sound quality is not good Boot strapping a collaborative filtering: Deep Learning for collaborative filtering: the other way to do collab, we can concatenate the embeddings (#q) can’t understand get_emb_sz method, fast. ai will give you the layer’s tensor size learn = collab_learner(dls, use_nn=True, y_range=(0, 5. 5), layers=[100,50])learn. fit_one_cycle(5, 5e-3, wd=0. 1)if you use params use_nn=True, you can use concat version of collab Sidebar: kwargs and delegates: End sidebar: Conclusion: Questionnaire: Tabular modelling: Categorical embeddings: It’s been a not much time that tabular data is used for deep learning model. Ex) German regions in embedding, if we draw embedding of the german city, it resembles actual german map many kinds of information of the world can be represented using embedding This is how google’s recommendation system works.  They use collab, which is concatenation of embeddingsgoogoo Beyond Deep Learning: sometimes the other model, which is not deep learning models(classical model) do better than modern deep learning model  Ensembles of decision trees (i. e. Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines), mainly for structured data (such as you might find in a database table at most companies) Multi-layered neural networks learnt with SGD (i. e. shallow and/or deep learning), mainly for unstructured data (such as audio, vision, and natural language)try 1 first, and after that try 2. How the decision tree ensenble works? we usually scikit-learn library. Refer this book  when you use y_range maximum as 5. 5? J: because it uses sigmoid, which can’t reach to the max, min value 2  Do you recommend real-time service using decision-tree? for my own experience it was too slow. J: The dataset: kaggle Competitions: Look at the data: At this point, a good next step is to handle ordinal columns and in this case, it is size of the product. we can make it as a categorical variables Jeremy read this part, this it when I do review Decision trees: It doesn’t require you special coding skill This is some good example of feature engineering Handling dates: Using TabularPandas and TabularProc: TabularProc - Tabular process, which is in-place function. Categorify - make column with a numeric value, which is same with we saw at vocab. And we should think about valiation, and at this case, making test set as random is not enough. because this is basically related to time. See how test set is divided, and we can set the validation set as future time data. Creating the decision tree: DecisionTree Regressor, something when we want to predict continuous variable.  Data augmentation for tabular data, do you have idea? J: Not sure, but will think about data semanticsunordered, and ordered category, does fast. ai distinguish between these? J: yes you can use fastai function when drawing decision tree. draw_tree(m, xs, size=7, leaves_parallel=True, precision=2)look at diagram from top to bottom. it’s the best way. basic way to do regression is predict the average. leaf-node: not further trees when it is False if you want to train further, we can choice leaf-note number bigger m_rmse(m, xs, y)&gt; 0. 0means we made perfect model, but when we check validation model, it’s bigger than 0	- one reason is related to leaf-node So we made our leaf-note to 25, and our result  do random tree (#f) ?? Categorical variables: related to categorical variables, we don’t have to do one-hot encode like using neural net! (we can make it, but there is no evidence it’s better)  What can I do with categorical missing value? J: (#f) Random forests: (#q could not understand much) bagging predictors  : “Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions… The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests… show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy. ” random subset, when you average the error, it is zero??? Also randomly choose the subset of columns Creating a random forest: def rf(xs, y, n_estimators=40, max_samples=200_000,    max_features=0. 5, min_samples_leaf=5, **kwargs):  return RandomForestRegressor(n_jobs=-1, n_estimators=n_estimators,    max_samples=max_samples, max_features=max_features,    min_samples_leaf=min_samples_leaf, oob_score=True). fit(xs, y)in general, when you increase the n_estimators, the accuracy enhances more plt. plot([r_mse(preds[:i+1]. mean(0), valid_y) for i in range(40)]); we can set up our own methods, to see what’s going on. you just picked first element of the result, and show them. but our evaluation get low. why? Out-of-bag error: it’s not about time set, we don’t need validation set to do it. Model interpretation: Tree variance for prediction confidence: How confident are we in our predictions using a particular row of data?  look at the standard deviation of the tree, how much did the tree were varied, and if we were very varied, it means we didn’t confident that muchFeature importance: For predicting with a particular row of data, what were the most important factors, and how did they influence that prediction?  m. feature_importance attributeRemoving low-importance variables: Which columns are the strongest predictors, which can we ignore? remove the ignorable tree, and re train, accuracy is about to same, but the number of feature decreased. after before we had this much features It decreased! Removing redundant features: Which columns are effectively redundant with each other, for purposes of prediction?How do predictions vary, as we vary these columns? in this way we can get simpler and simpler model, remaining the accuracy Partical dependence: best way is to draw histogram. we can draw depends on each label, and see parti what is said, how YearMade impact sales, if all other valud is equal? What might be impact just mitigate specific variable?  is cluster doing something related to hierarchical J: yes  How to the feature importance values related to correlation? J: if you used to linear regression (#f) / Larry D. Here is an answer from Fra Pochetti: If 2 features are highly correlated their relative feature importance would be reduced compared to keeping just one of the two. Here why. A random forest selects features randomly at each split (in general). If 2 variables are correlated, they more or less carry the same signal wrt the dependent variable. Hence you can expect a tree to split on either of the 2 evenly. As an end result, your 2 features will have much less importance, just because they are carrying the same information. They hide each other. I generally remove correlated features even if it is not strictly needed, just to be able to uncover these kind of hidden relationships and spot truly important variables. Data leakage: Tree interpreter: treeinterpreter module So we take that one row of data, and put it through the first decision tree, looking to see what split is used at each point throughout the tree. prediction[0], bias[0], contributions[0]. sum()Extrapolation and neural networks: Jeremy usually index using special value ‘None’, not unsqeeze. random forest can’t extrapolate out side of train set, what it has seen, and this is big problem Finding out of domain data: concatenating all of the independent variable, and ask is this data from training set or validation set? difference between valid data and train set, and extrapolation will not happen if it’s neural net. Using a neural network: Sidebar: fastai’s Tabular classes: In fastai, a tabular model is simply a model which takes columns of continuous or categorical data, and predicts a category (a classification model) or a continuous value (a regression model). Categorical independent variables are passed through an embedding, and concatenated, as we saw in the neural net we used for collaborative filtering, and then continuous variables are concatenated as well. End sidebar: Ensembling: It’s simple we can just do average. Boosting: another approach when we do ensemble, this is pretty sensitive to hyper-parameters  with tabular, dropping the feature is better than regularization? J: (#f) J: Combining embeddings with other methods: Entity embedding, which is EE Conclusion: our advice for tabular modeling: slow regarding inference time, because they have to infer at every tree Questionnaire: Jiwon, here is an answer from Jona R on the forum: Not certain, but I think that “0” was not actually a choice that users could rate. It seemed to me like it was used as a placeholder for “no rating” in some of Jeremy’s models. That means that the lowest you would need to predict is “1”, which means that setting range 0 provides sufficient buffer.       wasn’t it 3d? how can we draw it using 2d drawing? &#8617;        why it does not use minimum to minus? like [-0. 5, 5. 5] &#8617;    "

(#f) plot_multi can show you results of calling some function, which grab the dataset, how many transformed version we create?: infinite, each time we call it, we grab the new transformed dataset. (batch_size, channel, row, col) Basic CNN with batchnorm: nn. Conv2d(ni, nf, kernel_size = 3, stride=2, padding=1)how many channels you want? -&gt; as much as you want (#f)(1,8) -&gt; one channel coming in, 8: how many filters you want to come out conv(ni, nf) &lt;- ni, nf is input / output channel so as a result, 10 by 1 by 1 (which means grid size is 1) careful of the comment, which represents grid size it decreases by half since stride = 2 Refactor: exactly the same neural net. how can we improve this? Resnet-ish: Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition - skip connection, identity, res block  Motivation of the paper: 56 layer is way more worse than the 20-layer(shallow) network.  Idea: keep the 56 layers but make results identical with shallow version How: a building block, every two convolutions, add the results together with inputand this became legendary architecture Visualising the Loss Landscape of Neural Nets  x, y - weight space, y - loss without identity connection, it’s very bumpy and with res connection, and this is little bit similar with batch norm. except the last one, jeremy added res block without last layer. don’t forget to refactor your code . 9954, and NIPS 2015 the best paper was 0. 45% error - sota changes so fast MergeLayer SequentialEx : Sequential extended (#f) and real code, we don’t add, but concat.  and this is dense net.  memory intensive because how deep you go in, you have original data, but very little parameter (#q) (#f)really work well for segmentation (#f) re-building the modern architecture, and he keep trying to show …. . (#f) lesson3-camvid. ipynb: in order to color cluster, it has to know what that it is A guide to convolution arithmetic for deep learning - great picture show what does 3 by 3 half stride conv looks like. U-net, down sampling path. size keep decreasing, channels keep increasing. And at last the grid size came back to same. Then, how do we double the grid size? stride - half convolution -&gt; transposed convolution, deconvolution, and this is maybe 1, 2 years ago. why?  nearly all of the pixel is zero different amount of information to the different convolution path (see the paper, and understand myself)Solution: (1) Nearest neighbour interpolation  just copy twice, no zero, no computation. (2) bilinear interpolation - weighted average (this is pretty standard with picture) - kind of skip connection but not added to the every 2 conv block, but to the same stage of the downsampling to the same stage of the upsampling see the code how fastai implemented this encoder refers to the downsampling part, which is substituted with resnet unet_block is connection between the up-sampling and down-sampling class UnetBlockthey grab the hook, to use resnet, and up_out using up-sampling each time you see two convolutions like conv2(conv1()), you can think of what if I add the res block? probably you would get a better results. identity connection is done with 1) add 2) concat  Q. why call concat before conv1, conv2 and not after? (#q - see the code) / J: there’s no way to interact with channel (???) remember if you do 2 conv, it’s actually 3d, (#f)  Q. size of image feature layer changes, how does dense net work since it concatenate. / J: ?? (#f) 53:00:00 lesson7-suprres-gan: will use to another task, image restoration, which starts from the image but will make better image, like black-white to color, resolution, . . (#f) Crappified data: paraLLeL(crappify, il. items)fastai’s function which does crappification(it takes time quite much) we gonna use, pre-trained model, since we added some noise and we have to catch what original picture was. , which is watermark removal use MESLoss, and it normally expects two vectors, which can compare so we flat version. pre-trained part of unet is down-sampling part. GANs: Motivation of GAN: Our loss function doesn’t represent what we want.  we are missing the texture of pillow, blanket-&gt; the emergent of GAN. it uses another models(Critic, discriminator) for loss function t = 3761 » Jeremy explaination of GAN cons: if you don’t have pre-trained Critic/Generator, it’s kind of blind vs blind Save generated images: let’s create Critics (#q) reconstruct = True we will learn more of what’s going on inside at part2 if you don’t want to re-initiate the gpu ram, you can gc. collect() which will remove caching gpu. we will use Binary Cross Entropy but will not use resnot  Because of weight could be increased much that we can’t handle that, but will learn at part2we should be careful when using gan, loss which uses adaptive loss we not only use the critic to loss function, but also MSE loss because if we use only the Critics as loss function, generator could make irrelevant photo of the original image. GANs hates momentum. - but nobody figured it out. tough things of training gan - loss number is meaningless. / so you have to see the results from time to time (original craffied picture / generated picture / original picture)  Q. What kind of task you will not use U-net? / J: Unet is used when size of output is aligned to the input. so any kind of generative modelling and segmentation is also generative modelling because we should out pixel segments which is responding to original pixel. and it would be absurd if we use unet to the classification, because we just need the down-sampling process. lesson7-wgan: (skipped so fast…) interesting because we use bedrooms dataset the approach that we use is ‘can we create a bedroom?’ we feed the generator random noise and generator should return the de-noised bedroom. lesson7-superres: Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution doesn’t like the term ‘perceptual’ - jeremy prefers to say it is feature losses down-sampling part is called encoder, and vice versa same color represents same grid size (#f) explained idea but could not get. - t=5022 pick the l1 loss or mse ( no matter) grad is false since we will use only the loss class featureloss is the implementation of the paper (abandoned to write -&gt; too hard…. and too fast) upsize medium res data, and you can see the pixels enlarged focus. results is quite good DeOldify  the student of fast. ai, made colored picture who had the fast. ai course. (#f) and also said lots of idea related to this. we can new way of Crappification.  Q. how about using unet or gan to nlp, kind of generating shakespear’s novel. / J: possible, and it’s quite blue ocean, and will look thorough little bit at part2 Be sure not to understand at once, go through this at least 3 times or more RNNs:  square - input / arrow - layer / circle - activation / triangle - outputgo to the learn. summary and see the specifics we will do mat mul and non-linearity one(or more) more, but (??) will use same weight. bptt - back prop through time 13017 / 70 / bs - all dataset divide first by batch size, and after that, divide by length limit (but why??????) every mini-batch joins up with previous mini-batch (that’s why he showed textify) how we convert the diagram to the code rnn is just a refactoring, there’s nothing new. -&gt; but only just predicting last word is wasteful, so we will predict every word, which means just triangle comes inside the model. maintain state: Let’s keep the hidden state. (rnn is totally normal nn but just refactored) nn. RNN: this time we will render the output the other loop, which is nn. RNN bptt 20 means 20 layers of the diagram. 2-layer GRU: there are small nn which decide how much apply the nodes. GRU/lstm is depended on specifics "

We can do better because we just used the same learning rate for a whole trainingDiscriminative learning rates:  use slice at lr_max parameter means discriminative learning rate 3Selecting the number of epochs:    If you choose too big epoch, valid_loss will not change from specific point, and this is related to fit_one_cycle   What fit_one_cycle does?     different from just fit.    start purposely from low learning rate. and from the point of highest point, they decrease lr again   if error_rate stop from specific epoch, use that epoch as epoch and do it again    Loss is just a thing we want to approximate, so always care errorDeeper architectures:  It would be possible that you don’t want pre-trained but usually it’s helpful usually out of memory happens     about, . to_fp16(): half precision floating point, NVIDIA GPU support special tensor and it’s faster about 2x/3x   you can use this using module from fastai2. callback. fp16 import *    Try a small model before scaling up the model &lt; because bigger model doesn’t guarantee better performanceAssignment:  Don’t forget the questionnaire Read paper, Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks and see how you can get best results with adjusting learning rate, find out best learning rate by yourself!     of course you can see fast. ai learning rate source code    How do you know you can do better?J: you don’t know, who knows. just try and experiment  about . to_fp16() it doesn’t affect result?J: less bumpy, little bit better but not that big deal  question about randomJ: not does machine learning but deep learning specifically. For more info, see Rachael’s Linear Algebra course. Multi-label classification: Constructing a data block:  pandas, which is for dataframe     when you slicing, : is always optional   Read Python for Data Analysis class written by person who made pandas    dataset is abstract idea of class     If you get index, and length, it’s dataset.    string. ascii_lowercase is qualified dataset since it has length and index   If you index it mostly get tuple, independent variable and dependent variable.     Datasets is usually composed of not stack of data and label     fast. ai, we implemented use file name as independent variable, and through function we get dependent variable      Dataloader divides Datasets to batches, read the book   Datablock assumes basically we have 2 kind of variable     randomly select different validation set so we have different output whenever we call dataset   dblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, MultiCategoryBlock),          get_x = get_x, get_y = get_y)dsets = dblock. datasets(df)dsets. train[0](PILImage mode=RGB size=500x375, TensorMultiCategory([0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 1. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. ]))  PILImage mode=RGB size=500x375: independent variable, which is a input     we did transform filename to tensors   output is one-hot encoding    Shouldn’t it be an integer but why output(TensorMultiCategory([0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 1. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. ]))) is float?J: because we will use cross-entropy style loss, which does floating calculation  why we don’t use with floating point 8 bit?J: could be fast, but low precision (but maybe possible) Binary cross entropy: learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18)x,y = dls. train. one_batch()activs = learn. model(x)activs. shape you can try grapping the one batch of the data to the model, you can get an output.      Use adls. train. one_batch() function to ensure what’s going in and out   def binary_cross_entropy(inputs, targets):  inputs = inputs. sigmoid()  return -torch. where(targets==1, inputs, 1-inputs). log(). mean() result is 0 to 1 but we get a variable between 0 and 1 so that we use sigmoid   same reason as we said at softmax, normally we use log (fast and acurate)     explained the book   One-hot encoded target, use BCELoss accuracy as a metric only works for single label dataset     because accuracy does argmax which chooses largest number    so doing multi-categorical problem, use metrics which can compare each activation with some threshold(not selecting one value), and pass if the number over threshold     but we might want to change threshold depends on the input, so that we use partial function which sets default variable, and change if we want   learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet50, metrics=partial(accuracy_multi, thresh=0. 2)) the accuracy changes if I use different threshold     How can I get best threshold?   preds,targs = learn. get_preds()xs = torch. linspace(0. 05,0. 95,29)accs = [accuracy_multi(preds, targs, thresh=i, sigmoid=False) for i in xs]plt. plot(xs,accs); we can plot and select the best number and don’t have to care of overfitting (because it’s not that bumpy as rule of thumb)Regression:  two types of task at supervised learning 1) classification(discrete variable) 2) regression(continuous variable)Assemble the data:  get_image_files gather image recursively here, it important to setting evaluation to a specific person usingsplitter, not randomly selection -&gt; it’s continuous frame, so if you just select random data, it would be overestimated.  pytorch has tensor batch, channel, height, width regarding channel, image has 3 channels     you can see the version of R, G, B using the below code   im = image2tensor(Image. open('image/grizzly. jpg'))_, axs = subplots(1,3)for bear, ax, color in zip(im, axs, ('Reds', 'Greens', 'Blues')):	show_images(255-bear, ax=ax, cmap=color) can we give multi-channel bigger than 3?J: yes, it used often like when you use satellite image. But your pre-trained model is usually for a 3-channel and fastai handles that case, but is is just problem of axis Training a mode: learn. show_results(ds_idx=1, max_n=3, figsize=(6,8)) left of output is target, right is prediction Notice It’s interesting that basically our pre-trained model was trained for classification task. But it works well when you do regression     why? pre-trained model from ImageNet is collection of image’s features like, objects, color, texture, shadow and so on   so from pre-trained model, we can get the features of an image, and do the other job(e. g. , regression) with fine-tuning   Assignment:  go to the bear classifier, and find out when you give image which is not included in label and see what happens.  change model from single labelling to multi-labelling, and tell what happened at fastai forum at traditional machine learning we used cross-validation, we don’t use it at deep learning?J: First, nowadays cross-validations are less common(if not on kaggle, because praction of data is important), because cross-validation was used there were not lots of data. Second, cross-validation is not related selection between machine learning and deep learning  CF algorithm used other than recommendation systemJ: whatever it’s kind of recommendation system, if concept is finding out the other candidates using the previous behaviour  how can i make data set if I have video? how split?(time phrase)J: like full color movie, rank-5 tensor by (time, h, w, batch, channel). but usually it would be 4 tensor, because of size of tensor or key problem, but theoretically possible. Collaborative filtering:  empty part means user didn’t watch or rate the movie upper and below part represent same info Learning the latent factors:  CF algorithm is related to latent variable(;factors) since we don’t have a label explaining/depicting properties which made you choose specific movie     In other words, there is no specific label how we could predict the dependent variable(recommendation; movies user didn’t watch) results from independent var(rating regarding user and movie)   but we can assume it has labels like genres and make matrix representing it    randomly create user’s factor(;latent, hidden) and movie’s factor. and do matrix multiplication with those, which is dot product.  and sum it and compare with target, so that you can learn parameters, which were randomly initializedCreating the DataLoaders:    Let’s make DataLoaders using basic python and PyTorch!   user and movie is represented using index, label,. . ,called look up in an index     but this is problem, because DL treats only kind of matrix multiplication.    so that we make one-hot encoding matrix    And this is quite amazing because it came out with any kind of discrete value, we can make it work using arrays how is different when you treat actual data between dense and sparse data?J: we will not treat sparse data, but there’s course Rachael’s linear algebra  embedding layer: multiplying by a one hot encoded matrix, using the computational shortcut that it can be implemented by simply indexing directly.      there is excel explaining detailed computation   This is important because usually people think embedding is something difficult, but it’s just computational shortcut to do matrix multiplication   Collaborative filtering from scratch:  importance of dunder method of python. (like __init__)     explained OOP concept    Inheritance of python, which used DotProduct class     Module is fast. ai version of pytorch’s nn. Module    forwardfunction grab embedding, using specific index     (again) Remember Embedding is just kind of shortcut to make a one-hot encoding matrix   class DotProduct(Module):  def __init__(self, n_users, n_movies, n_factors):    self. user_factors = Embedding(n_users, n_factors)    self. movie_factors = Embedding(n_movies, n_factors)      def forward(self, x):    users = self. user_factors(x[:,0])    movies = self. movie_factors(x[:,1])    return (users * movies). sum(dim=1) 64: size of mini_batch, 2: indexx,y = dls. one_batch()x. shapetorch. Size([64, 2])    We use bias to represent specific character of each user and movie, because embedding of user/movie doesn’t show users’ character, who might generally doesn’t like movie     what should we do when my model is overfitting very quickly with small epoch      i. e. , what should we do to evade overfitting and don’t want to lessen epoch?   augmentation can be one solution but we can’t do augmentation with this data   in this case, we do other regularization, which means panellize the fast learning 4    Collaborative filtering algorithm works better than svd or kind of that?J: yes My Questions       no way to see with regression model? &#8617;        But how do I know if loss decreases slowly or not? &#8617;        I need to study more of scheduled learning &#8617;        Isn’t there any side effects when you did too much regularization? &#8617;    "

Intermediate layers, which is weight matrix is 1) 1000, and 2) 500 -&gt; which means our parameter would be 500*1000. learn. modelWhat is dropout and embedding dropout?: Nitish Srivastava, Dropout: A Simple way to prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting  you can dropout with p value, make it specified to specific layer, or make it applied to all the layers.  Pytorch code 1) bernoulli, which decides whether you will hold it? 2) and divide the noise value depends on noise value. so noise became 2 or remain 0.      According to pytorch code, We do change at training time, but we do nothing at test time. and this means you don’t have to do anything special with inference time. ’   TODO: find at forums what is inference time - Related to NVIDIA, GPU.     Embedding dropout is just a dropout.      It’s different between continuous variable and embedding layer.  TODO Still can’t understand. why embedding dropout is effective. or,… in need.    Let’s delete at random, some of the results of the embedding.    and It worked well especially at Kaggle   Batch Normalization: Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift -&gt; came out false! According to How Does Batch Normalization Help Optimization?  The key was multiplicative bias gamma and additive bias beta Explain     Let $$ \hat{y} = f(w_1, w_2, w_3, … , x) $$ , loss = MSE , Then y_range should be between 1 and 5   And Activation function ends with -1 -&gt; +1   To mitigate this problem, we can add another parameter, like $$w_n$$   But there’re so much interactions in the process so just re-scale the output.    Momentum parameter at BatchNorm1d:  Different from momentum like in optimization.  This momentum is Exponentially weighted moving average of the mean, instead of deviation.      If this is small number: mean standard deviation would be less from mini_batch to mini_batch » less regularization effect. (If this is large number, variation would be greater from mini_batch to mini_batch » more regularization effect)   TODO: can’t sure, but i understand, this is not about how to update parameter but about how much reflect previous value when scale and shift   Q. Preference between batchnorm and the other regularizations(drop out, weight decay) A. Nope, always try and see the results lesson6-pets-more. ipynb: Data Augmentation:  Last reg get_transforms has lots of params (even not yet learned all) -&gt; check documentation     Remember you can implement all the doc contents bc it’s made from nbdev   TODO: try this!!    Essence of data augmentation is you should maintain the label, while somewhat making sense.      ex) tilt, because it’s optically sensible, you can always change the angle of the data view.     zeros, border, and reflection but always reflection works most of the time, so that is the defaultConvolutional Kernel(What is convolution?):  Will make heat_map from scratch, which means the parts convolution focuses on  http://setosa. io/ev/image-kernels/     javascript thing   How convolution works   Kernel. which does element-wise multiplication, and sum them up   so it has on pixel less at borders -&gt; so it uses padding, and fastai uses reflection as said.     why this Kernel(matrix) helps catching horizontal edge side?     because below kernel weights differently, depends on x axis   why familiar, because it’s similar intuition with Zeiler/Fergus Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks paper     CNN from different viewpoints     output of pixel is results from different linear equations.    If you connect this with represents of neural network nodes, you can see that the specific inp nodes connected with specific out nodes.    Summarize: cnn does 1) matmul some of the elements are always zero 2) same weight for every row, which is called weight time? weight. . ?, 1:18:50 (picture)   Further lowdown:  Because generally image has 3 channels, we need rank 3 kernel.  And do multiply with all channel output is one pixel. (draw by your self)     but this kernel will catch one feature, like horizontal, so that we make more kernel so that output becomes (h * w * kernel)   And that kernel come to channel    Stride 2 conv: with 3 by 3 kernel, stride 2 conv -&gt; (h/2 * w/2 * kernel) 1     skip or jump over input pixel   to protect from memory out of control   learn. modellearn. summary()TODO: understand yourself the blocks of conv-kernel:  Usually use big kernel size at first layer (will study this at part2) 2 Bottom&amp;right highlighting kernel, since that parts are positive numbersk = tensor([  [0.  ,-5/3,1],  [-5/3,-5/3,1],  [1.  ,1  ,1],]). expand(1,3,3,3)/6 Why divided by 6, when doing expand? : forum answer torch. tensor. expand: for memory efficient, because we should do RGB We do not make separate kernel, but make rank 4 kernel     4d tensor is just stacked kernel    t[None]. shape create new unit axis, and why? we make this -&gt; it should move unit of batch, not one size image. Average pooling, feature:  suppose our pre-trained model results in size of 11 by 11 by 512 and my classification task has 37 classes     take the first face of channel, which is 11 by 11 and mean it, so that make rank 2 tensor, 512 by 1   and make 2d matrix, which is 512 by 37 and multiply so that we can get 37 by 1 matrix.     Feature, at convolution block     So, when we transfer-learning without unfreeze, every element of last matrix (512 by 1) should represent(or could catch) each feature.    Heatmap, Hook: hook_output(model[0]) -&gt; acts -&gt; avg_acts if we average the block with axis=feature, result of matrix(11 by 11) depicts how activated was that area? -&gt; it is heatmap, avg_acts and acts comes from hook, which is more advanced pytorch feature.      hook into pytorch machine itself, and run any arbitrary Pytorch code   Why this is cool?: Normally it gives set of outputs of forward pass, but we can interrupt and hook the forward pass.    Also can store the output of the convolutional part of the model, which is before avg_pooling    Thinking back when we do cut off after the conv part.      but with fast. ai the original convolutional part of the model would be the first thing in the model, specifically could be given from learn. model. eval()[0]   And this is gotten from hooked_output and having hooked the output, we can pass our x_minibatch to output.    Not directly, but with normalized, minibatch, put on to the gpu   one_item() function do it, when we have one data TODO: this is assignment do it yourself without one_item function   and . cuda() put it on gpu    you should print out very often the shape of tensor, and try think why. (personal) Further research  Yes, as notes of official course, the ConvNN have become more and more important for other ML model but computer vision. (see Convolutional Block Attention Module relationship paper) and nlp is much more fall behind of computer vision at modern deep learning research, less augmentation method, resource optimization, performance(even not comparable, they both has standard task), … SO How about enhance nlp model using this (kind of) relationship? 3Footnote       what is conv1d, conv2d, conv3d? &#8617;        why use comparatively huge kernel at first layer? &#8617;        Actually already going on similarly [] &#8617;    "

What is a difference between image and imageSegment?: imageSegment  An ImageSegment object has the same properties as an Image. The only difference is that when applying the transformations to an ImageSegment, it will ignore the functions that deal with lighting and keep values of 0 and 1.  It’s easy to show the segmentation mask over the associated Image by using the y argument of show_image. img = open_image(fnames[0])mask = open_mask(lbl_names[0])_,axs = plt. subplots(1,3, figsize=(8,4))img. show(ax=axs[0], title='no mask')img. show(ax=axs[1], y=mask, title='masked') #seg mask over the img using y argmask. show(ax=axs[2], title='mask only', alpha=1. ) vision. image ##4. Why/How img div by 255 and how it results fast. ai : vision. image - If div=True, pixel values are divided by 255. to become floats between 0. and 1.  At times, you want to get rid of distortions caused by lights and shadows in an image.    Normalizing the RGB values of an image can at times be a simple and effective way of achieving this.     So sum of the pixel’s value over all channels(which is S) divides each intensified channel so that nomalized value will be R/S, G/S and B/S (where, S=R+G+B).   Detailed explain here4. Python Evaluation Order: Python evaluates expressions from left to right. Notice that while evaluating an assignment, the right-hand side is evaluated before the left-hand side. mask_tmp, trg_tmp, void_tmp = 2, 1, 10mask_tmp = trg_tmp != void_tmpprint(mask_tmp, trg_tmp, void_tmp) # (1) target is not same with voidTrue 1 10# Example 1x = 1y = 2x,y = y,x+yx, y(2, 3)# Example 2x = 1y = 2x = yy = x+yx, y(2, 4)5. model learner parameter :: pct_start: A: Percentage of total number of epochs when learning rate rises during one cycle. Q: Sorry, I still confused that one cycle in the new API only runs one epoch. How the percentage of total number of epochs works? Can you give a example? If learn. fit_one_cycle(10, slice(1e-4,1e-3,1e-2), pct_start=0. 05)??A: Ok, strictly correct answer would be percentage of iterations, so you can have lr both increase and decrease during same epoch. In your example, say, you have 100 iterations per epoch, then for half an epoch (0. 05 * (10 * 100) = 50) lr will rise, then slowly decrease. Q2: Thanks for this explanation … so essentially, it is the percentage of overall iterations where the LR is increasing, correct? So, given the default of 0. 3, it means that your LR is going up for 30% of your iterations and then decreasing over the last 70%. Is that a correct summation of what is happening? A2: Yes, I think that’s correct. You can verify that by changing its value and check:learn. recorder. plot_lr() For example if pct_start = 0. 2 source: forums. fastai "

You should not standarlize validation set because training set and validation set should be aparted.  after normalize, mean is close to zero, and standard deviation is close to 1. 1. 2 Variable definition:  n,m: size of the training set c: the number of activations we need in our model2. Foundation Version: 2. 1 Basic architecture:  Our model has one hidden layer, output to have 10 activations, used in cross entropy.

What is a convolution?: A convolutional neural network is that your red, green, and blue pixels go into the simple computation, and something comes out of that, and then the result of that goes into a second layer, and the result of that goes into the third layer and so forth. Visualization: one kernel Refer this site for visualizing CNN filteringMatthew D Zeiler &amp; Rob Fergus PaperLecture01     Nine examples of the actual coefficients from the **first layer**  Convolution can be represented as matmul: CNNs from different viewpoints {align-items: center;}    [A B C D E F G H I J] is 3 by 3 image data flatten to vector.   As a result, convolution is a just matrix just two things happens     Some of entries are set to zeros at all the times   same color always have the same weight. That called weight time / wegith sharing    So, we can implement a convolution with matrix multiplication. But, we don’t do that because it’s slow!Padding:  What most of libraries do is just put zeros asdie of matrix  fast. ai uses reflection paddings (what is this? Jeremy said he uttered it)Kernel has rank 3:  As standard picture input would be 4 5, it would be actually 3d, not 2d.  If we make kernel as a 3x3 size, we pass over same kernel all the different Red, Green, Blue Pixels.      This could make problem, because, if we want to detect frog, which is green, we would want more activations on the green(I made a test cell in my colab 6)   How can we find a side-edge, a gradient and area of constant weight?: Not top-edge!  One kernel can find only the top-edge, so we should stack the kernels 7 So, we pass it through bunch of kernels to the input images, and that process gives us height x width x corresponding number of kernels.  Usually that number of chanel is 16 And if we want to get the more channels and features, we should repeat that process     This process gives rise to memory out of control, we do the stride   #### conv-example. xlsx  2 convolutional filters At a second layer, filter is 3x3x2 tensor, because to add up together the first layer’s channel.

Before I came here, it was a little bit vague concept. I’m still not sure ‘what is agile’ but this is how we tried to make agile process.  Daily Stand-up(planning): Sharing the works everyday helps interdisciplinary team to work better. Since product started to get higher fidelity, the gap between engineer and non-engineer increased. Actually I didn’t planned to explain concept because I thougth I would be lose my audience when I start to explain. But as daily stand-up, which shares our progess, goes day by day, I planed and reported the issues. And it made each other’s topic feel more familiar. I think point is very important, because at that point people start to be curious. So we can actively ask to the others, and that momwnr, we can explain the point teammate dosen’t know.     Each color means every different section. Red: Our team goal, Blue: Interaction designer, Green: Product manager, Yellow: Software/AI engineer      This week engineer's main plan  Each of us try to explain what we are doing, but things become easier when we are asked. Because we explained something was important to us before, but if we asked it is something important for the others. Gemba Walk:     Team Cero with core team  Every 2 weeks, we do the Gemba work, which is ‘question everything to the core team’ time. At this period, people can ask anything related to our product, workshop, and framework. Core team will help just for each team, and each team can solve the problem related to their work. &lt; br/&gt;Why we need this session? because with workshop and general schedule, core team has no time just focus on each team. So through this session, we can have opportunity to understand each program and workshop, like why we are using this platform, and when is the due of our small project, and we have this problem and we need help for this. whatever small problem you have, core team is always willing to help you. Sprint Reviews: Every Friday, we have time to summarise what we did for the week. Maybe we need HMW question and our storymap to share our process and then tell and share what we did try, what point we succeeded and what point it was deviant of our prediction, and why we tried it. .     Sprint of Ve-link  And then, just after all team’s ppt, we do vote with such a cute marvel. Always it’s very difficult to vote (of course you can’t vote to your team!) Because it depends on criteria what do I value!But since this is process of our agile work, I try to focus on what they have changed since last week, and why they did it, how they did it. Engineering weekly: Every engineering weekly we exchange our knowledge each other so that we can grow together. Everyone have their knowledge to share and we can be tutor and at the same time can be of tutee. Previously, my AI collegues presented regression, knn. And because I’m somewhat specialized to NLP, I prepared slide that explain about pre-trained language model, but my header advised me if I go deep of theoretical things, I would lose my audience. So I decided to brief BERT mode, how I can contribute to other team’s project. Since BERT was breakthrough of NLP industry, I tried to explain how it can be applied to hands on product and how it can help people in their product. The result was quite motivative to me. They gave feedback that since it wasn’t that much theoretical, they could enjoy it, and useful information. Someone asked me do I had learned of presentation before. I was really happy with their feedback! "

Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks One of the way to find good learning rate. Core idea is to start with small learning rate (like 1e-4, 1e-3) and increase the learning rate after each mini-batch till loss starts exploding. And pick up learning rate one order lower than exploding point. For example, plotted learning rate is like below picture, picking up around 1e-2 is the best way.  Why this methods Traditionally, the learning rate is decreased as the learning starts converging with time. But this paper suggests to cycle our learning rate, because it makes us avoid local minimum. Basically this cyclic method enables us to explore whole of loss function so that find out global minimum. In other words, higher learning rate behaves like regularisation. Let’s find-tune: Do train just one last layer by learning rate found by find_lr This section you should find the strongest downward slope that kind of sticking around for quite a while. And choose just one order lower than lowest point. As explained before, I will pick up 1e-2. And of course, this is fine-tuning, we don’t need discriminative learning rate yet.  Let’s train the whole model!: link When you plot the learning rate again, maybe you will get soaring shape of learning rate. Rule of thumb, When you slice the learning rate, use learning rate you used at unfrozen part. Divide it by 5 or 10 and put it on maximum bound. At minimum bound, get the point just before it soared, and divide it by 10.  Let’s make batch size bigger!: Since default batch size is 64, I tried it to 128. And it gets way more better result(even it’s still underfitting!) And if I freeze model and train whole model again, the model would be better. Also, you can use this method to the other big dataset model training! Interpretation: See the confusion matrix. Result is quite great. *Since I’m using colab, I will skip data cleansing. But I highly recommend you to use ImageCleaner widget, only if you are using jupyter notebook (not jupyter lab) Model in production: You can deploy your model in simple way.

    "body": "2020/02/05 - Motivation: Before now, me as a undergraduate student, I was parsimony who usually depend on colab, kaggle, friend’s server(occasional) whenever i need GPU. . And this time it’s been for a while to install GPU than I expected and I share the several component that stood in my way. Written at Oct 24 2019, if you think this is deprecated, please do not have a leap of faith. Just for the record, I’ve used Kaggle, Colab, GCP, Azure, EC2 as GPU cloud. 1. Did not know there is JupyterLab option in Google Cloud Platform. : At the first time when GCP came out, there was no AI Platform service. So from starting vm instance to launching jupyter and installing packages, I did all of the things myself. (and I learned 🤗) $	curl -O https://repo. continuum. io/archive/Anaconda3-5. 0. 1-Linux-x86_64. sh[Downloading conda in ssh] I created VM instance,selected zone, machine type and disk type. Then, define firewall rules and in ssh terminal, install jupyter and other packages. But you can do all of these things just using AI Platform.  [AI Platform] I think it especially save your time if you are living in Asia-Pacific, which google doesn’t support not that much GPU resources.  2. Consider if the platform has limited resources in a region you live in. : I live in South Korea, East Asia, and it seems like this region has lots of limitation in GPU (except quite expensive AWS) And the Taiwan which was the only one region where I can launch my own VM with GPU (I tried all the other regions in the list) sometimes do normaly, but not always. 😥After launching, I did several works and next day I could not start VM. (I didn’t count it, but tried it a few hours because I didn’t want cost any more time…) Endlessly failed to start instance, then I choose to move AWS as an alternative way. 3. Fast. ai gives deliberate guide and I didn’t know it. : Fast. ai offer the guide for all available platform. (Colab, salamander, Gradient, Kaggle, Colab, and so on) It is so important, and really needs, because cloud computing options are vary as occasion and purpose arise.

You should wait to add more volume just after add volume, by building AWS EC2. : Since Elastic Block Store(EBS) storage supports optimized storage, users can’t extend storage volume two times in a row.

In doing so, I noticed I’m not listed as contributor of repo which my PR accessed. How did I come to a repository?: When I’m stuck, I would prefer to code, than to go deep in theory. (It must be so. . too much to understand 🤒)It was BERT released by Google AI I felt keenly the necessity of implementing, because not only couldn’t understand the way they figured out positional encoding formula, but how it actually works. What does it mean to “scale” dot product in Attention? (Now I know it’s far from my section 😂) Figure 1. Scaled Dot Product. Adopted from tensorflow blogWhat was the code error?: For implement code in paper, I read the papers Transformer and BERT, structured the model, and refered the others’ code. Meanwhile, I found out a small error in tokenization process, which was changing a token into [MASK], enabled bidirectional representation. I’ve made PR, and got merged. But I was not in contributors. Why?: Figure 2. Merged Pull request Adopted from graykode projectActually I happened to know there can be couple of reasons github doesn’t include my name as contributor. Well, if contributors tab has more than 100 people, in which case it shows you up only if you are in the top 100 contributors because displaying too many contributors can make webpages down. Somethimes, however, it doesn’t that problem. Why not? Two possibilities are there.    First, According to Joel-Glovier, if repository maintainer merged-as-a-rebase PR will end up showing as maintainer’s commit. But maintainer shouldn’t normally do this.     Second, if you happend to commit using a different git email that what is in your GitHub profile, it will not be attached to your Github user, and “doesn’t show up” as you.

I stopped talking because the truth was complicated, even though I knew, deep within, that one should never, ever remain silent for fear of complexity.         &lt;Figure 1&gt; Elif Shafak   Photo credit: www. elifsafak. com. tr      I want to talk about emotions and the need to boost our emotional intelligence. I think it’s a pity that mainstream political theory pays very little attention to emotions.     Oftentimes, analysts and experts are so busy with data and metrics that they seem to forget those things in life that are difficult to measure and perhaps impossible to cluster under statistical models. But I think this is a mistake, for two main reasons. We are emotional beings.     I think it’s going to be one of our biggest intellectual challenges, because our political systems are replete with emotions. In country after country, we have seen illiberal politicians exploiting these emotions. And yet within the academia and among the intelligentsia, we are yet to take emotions seriously.
