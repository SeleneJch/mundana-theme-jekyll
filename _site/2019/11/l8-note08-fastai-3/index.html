Designing great data products Great predictive modeling is an important part of the solution, but it no longer stands on its own; as products become more sophisticated, it disappears into the plumbing. Designing great data products And he is also famous for words. Here are some.  we’re going to try and use that to really understand what’s going on. So to warn you, none of it is rocket science but a lot of its going to look really new. So don’t expect to get it the first time but expect to listen and jump into the notebook try a few things test things out look particularly at like tensor shapes and inputs and outputs to check your understanding then go back and listen again. But and kind of try it, a few times, because you will get there right, it’s just that there’s going to be a lot of new concepts because we haven’t done that much stuff in pure Pytorch.

The reason for this is that due to rounding errors from math operations, matrices may not be exactly the same. As a result, we want a function that will “is a equal to b within some tolerance” #exportdef near(a,b):   return torch. allclose(a, b, rtol=1e-3, atol=1e-5)def test_near(a,b):   test(a,b,near)test_near(t1, matmul(m1, m2))3.

Tensor instancestride(dim) -&gt; tuple or intReturns the stride of :attr:’self’ tensor. Stride is the jump necessary to go from one element to the next one in the specified dimension :attr:’dim’. A tuple of all strides is returned when no argument is passed in. Otherwise, an integer value is returned as the stride in the particular dimension :attr:’dim’. Args:  dim (int, optional): the desired dimension in which stride is requiredExample::* x = torch. tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])`x. stride()&gt;&gt;&gt; (5, 1)x. stride(0)&gt;&gt;&gt; 5x. stride(-1)&gt;&gt;&gt; 1   unsqueeze &amp; None index   We can manipulate rank of tensor Special value ‘None’, which means please squeeze a new axis here== please broadcast herec = torch. tensor([10,20,30])c[None,:] in c, squeeze a new axis in here please. 2. 2 Matmul with broadcasting: for i in range(ar):#  c[i,j] = (a[i,:]).      *[:,j]. sum() #previous  c[i]  = (a[i]. unsqueeze(-1) * b). sum(dim=0) And Using None also (As howard teached)c[i]  = (a[i ]. unsqueeze(-1) * b). sum(dim=0) #howardc[i]  = (a[i][:,None] * b). sum(dim=0) # using Nonec[i]  = (a[i,:,None]*b). sum(dim=0)⭐️Tips🌟 1) Anytime there’s a trailinng(final) colon in numpy or pytorch you can delete it ex) c[i, :] = c [i]2) any number of colon commas at the start, you can switch it with the single elipsis.  ex) c[:,:,:,:,i] = c […,i] 2. 3 Broadcasting Rules:  What if we tensor. size([1,3]) * tensor. size([3,1])?  torch.

In doing so, I noticed I’m not listed as contributor of repo which my PR accessed. How did I come to a repository?: When I’m stuck, I would prefer to code, than to go deep in theory. (It must be so. . too much to understand 🤒)It was BERT released by Google AI I felt keenly the necessity of implementing, because not only couldn’t understand the way they figured out positional encoding formula, but how it actually works. What does it mean to “scale” dot product in Attention? (Now I know it’s far from my section 😂) Figure 1. Scaled Dot Product. Adopted from tensorflow blogWhat was the code error?: For implement code in paper, I read the papers Transformer and BERT, structured the model, and refered the others’ code. Meanwhile, I found out a small error in tokenization process, which was changing a token into [MASK], enabled bidirectional representation. I’ve made PR, and got merged. But I was not in contributors. Why?: Figure 2. Merged Pull request Adopted from graykode projectActually I happened to know there can be couple of reasons github doesn’t include my name as contributor. Well, if contributors tab has more than 100 people, in which case it shows you up only if you are in the top 100 contributors because displaying too many contributors can make webpages down. Somethimes, however, it doesn’t that problem. Why not? Two possibilities are there.    First, According to Joel-Glovier, if repository maintainer merged-as-a-rebase PR will end up showing as maintainer’s commit. But maintainer shouldn’t normally do this.     Second, if you happend to commit using a different git email that what is in your GitHub profile, it will not be attached to your Github user, and “doesn’t show up” as you.

I think it’s a pity that mainstream political theory pays very little attention to emotions.     Oftentimes, analysts and experts are so busy with data and metrics that they seem to forget those things in life that are difficult to measure and perhaps impossible to cluster under statistical models. But I think this is a mistake, for two main reasons. We are emotional beings.     I think it’s going to be one of our biggest intellectual challenges, because our political systems are replete with emotions. In country after country, we have seen illiberal politicians exploiting these emotions. And yet within the academia and among the intelligentsia, we are yet to take emotions seriously.

    "body": "2019/10/23 - Motivation: Before now, me as a undergraduate student, I was parsimony who usually depend on colab, kaggle, friend’s server(occasional) whenever i need GPU. . And this time it’s been for a while to install GPU than I expected and I share the several component that stood in my way. Written at Oct 24 2019, if you think this is deprecated, please do not have a leap of faith. Just for the record, I’ve used Kaggle, Colab, GCP, Azure, EC2 as GPU cloud. 1. Did not know there is JupyterLab option in Google Cloud Platform. : At the first time when GCP came out, there was no AI Platform service. So from starting vm instance to launching jupyter and installing packages, I did all of the things myself. (and I learned 🤗) $	curl -O https://repo. continuum. io/archive/Anaconda3-5. 0. 1-Linux-x86_64. sh[Downloading conda in ssh] I created VM instance,selected zone, machine type and disk type. Then, define firewall rules and in ssh terminal, install jupyter and other packages. But you can do all of these things just using AI Platform.  [AI Platform] I think it especially save your time if you are living in Asia-Pacific, which google doesn’t support not that much GPU resources.  2. Consider if the platform has limited resources in a region you live in. : I live in South Korea, East Asia, and it seems like this region has lots of limitation in GPU (except quite expensive AWS) And the Taiwan which was the only one region where I can launch my own VM with GPU (I tried all the other regions in the list) sometimes do normaly, but not always. 😥After launching, I did several works and next day I could not start VM. (I didn’t count it, but tried it a few hours because I didn’t want cost any more time…) Endlessly failed to start instance, then I choose to move AWS as an alternative way. 3. Fast. ai gives deliberate guide and I didn’t know it. : Fast. ai offer the guide for all available platform. (Colab, salamander, Gradient, Kaggle, Colab, and so on) It is so important, and really needs, because cloud computing options are vary as occasion and purpose arise. I didn’t know fast. ai has manual to running GCP, and I think it’s as good a reason as any for me to be have taken time. It helped me so much when I had aws and shortened my time. I don’t want to read all of the manual in amazno. . (It is recommended. . but I’d rather read GIT PRO now…) ssh -i ~/. ssh/&lt;your_private_key_pair&gt; -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 ubuntu@&lt;your instance IP&gt;4. You should wait to add more volume just after add volume, by building AWS EC2. : Since Elastic Block Store(EBS) storage supports optimized storage, users can’t extend storage volume two times in a row.  Unfortunately, at the first time, I didn’t know it (again 👻) and when VM lacked volume, I doubled dist capacity (76*2) at a rough but It needs more.  &lt;!– this time I installed GPU in two years, and it became little complicated compared to 2 years ago. And this time for the first time(maybe not the first time. . but i handled it in my class or with my friend. but it’s my first time on my own. ) I very I’m started to using used google colab, kaggleand, GCP-JupyterLab, ec2 - friend made, aws vm machine but I had a environment variable but i did not know of it. On these days, I could not get a resources from taiwan…    I couldn’t notice a deliberate     Anyway, as a result I tried myself gcp myself and aws ec2 with fast. ai But I think doing on my self surely takes much time (in this point I wonder why I’m doing this, and should remind me, especially I was studying disk volume optimization)     disk volume exceed - https://askubuntu. com/questions/919748/no-space-left-on-device-even-though-there-is:  "
