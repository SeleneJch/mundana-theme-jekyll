And I did what I usually do in similar situations: I stammered, I shut down, and I stopped talking. I stopped talking because the truth was complicated, even though I knew, deep within, that one should never, ever remain silent for fear of complexity.         &lt;Figure 1&gt; Elif Shafak   Photo credit: www. elifsafak. com. tr      I want to talk about emotions and the need to boost our emotional intelligence. I think it’s a pity that mainstream political theory pays very little attention to emotions.     Oftentimes, analysts and experts are so busy with data and metrics that they seem to forget those things in life that are difficult to measure and perhaps impossible to cluster under statistical models. But I think this is a mistake, for two main reasons. We are emotional beings.     I think it’s going to be one of our biggest intellectual challenges, because our political systems are replete with emotions. In country after country, we have seen illiberal politicians exploiting these emotions. And yet within the academia and among the intelligentsia, we are yet to take emotions seriously. I think we should.  1 2 Reference:       British Council Worldwide &#8617;        Ted Talk &#8617;    "

I think, no doubt, It’s a supercompetitive world. After watching this vedio, I remembered meeting an acountant partner at a Big 4 firm, 3 years ago. I met him via mentoring system in university, so the acountant partner encouraged me to be a acountant, because they rate SNU highly. Besides, the acountant said, to be frankly said, what neighborhood &amp; school(even high school), where they are living now(commute time!) and single or married are more liable than anything.  Well You know, those values are relatively objective than cover letter or your apperance… anything. When I left his firm, after mentoring, he happened a junior staff. “She is married women and graduated from just that schoo. But her performance quite good. Outlier. ” And the acountant’s word, which I’ve heard 3 years ago, coincides in “Digital Future”2 that regard creativity creates noise.       Ted talk &#8617;        Digital Future &#8617;    "

    "body": "2019/10/30 - From the end of last year, big changes have witnessed in NLP research. Embracing an unprecedented growth, I started to study new exciting results and advances. In doing so, I noticed I’m not listed as contributor of repo which my PR accessed. How did I come to a repository?: When I’m stuck, I would prefer to code, than to go deep in theory. (It must be so. . too much to understand 🤒)It was BERT released by Google AI I felt keenly the necessity of implementing, because not only couldn’t understand the way they figured out positional encoding formula, but how it actually works. What does it mean to “scale” dot product in Attention? (Now I know it’s far from my section 😂) Figure 1. Scaled Dot Product. Adopted from tensorflow blogWhat was the code error?: For implement code in paper, I read the papers Transformer and BERT, structured the model, and refered the others’ code. Meanwhile, I found out a small error in tokenization process, which was changing a token into [MASK], enabled bidirectional representation. I’ve made PR, and got merged. But I was not in contributors. Why?: Figure 2. Merged Pull request Adopted from graykode projectActually I happened to know there can be couple of reasons github doesn’t include my name as contributor. Well, if contributors tab has more than 100 people, in which case it shows you up only if you are in the top 100 contributors because displaying too many contributors can make webpages down. Somethimes, however, it doesn’t that problem. Why not? Two possibilities are there.    First, According to Joel-Glovier, if repository maintainer merged-as-a-rebase PR will end up showing as maintainer’s commit. But maintainer shouldn’t normally do this.     Second, if you happend to commit using a different git email that what is in your GitHub profile, it will not be attached to your Github user, and “doesn’t show up” as you.  Reference:  Michał Chromiak’s blog Github: why are my contributions are not showing on my profile atlassian-gitfetch"

			<p>“Humans are no longer valued for our creativity.<br />
Now we are just valued for our data”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup><br /></p>

<p>It does require specific conditions that people are living in the competitive.<br /></p>

<p>I think, no doubt, It’s a supercompetitive world.<br /></p>

<p><em>After watching this vedio, I remembered meeting an acountant partner at a Big 4 firm, 3 years ago.</em><br />
I met him via mentoring system in university, so the acountant partner encouraged me to be a acountant, because they rate SNU highly.<br />
Besides, the acountant said, to be frankly said, what neighborhood &amp; school(even high school), where they are living now(commute time!) and single or married are more liable than anything.<br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well You know, those values are relatively objective than cover letter or your apperance… anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I left his firm, after mentoring, he happened a junior staff.</p>

<p>“She is married women and graduated from just that schoo. But her performance quite good. Outlier.”</p>

<p>And the acountant’s word, which I’ve heard 3 years ago, coincides in “Digital Future”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> that regard creativity creates noise.</p>
