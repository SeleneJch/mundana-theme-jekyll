Organizers emphasized our responsibility, and if I passed each other’s burden, It could be my burden next time. In solidarity of the obligation, we finished conference well. And after participating PyCon Korea 2018 as volunteer, I’ve joined PyCon Korea Organizer last year.  &lt;Figure 1&gt; First meeting of PyCon 2019 Korea Organizer It’s been a while since PyCon 2019 finished.

I think, no doubt, It’s a supercompetitive world. After watching this vedio, I remembered meeting an acountant partner at a Big 4 firm, 3 years ago. I met him via mentoring system in university, so the acountant partner encouraged me to be a acountant, because they rate SNU highly. Besides, the acountant said, to be frankly said, what neighborhood &amp; school(even high school), where they are living now(commute time!) and single or married are more liable than anything.  Well You know, those values are relatively objective than cover letter or your apperance… anything. When I left his firm, after mentoring, he happened a junior staff. “She is married women and graduated from just that schoo. But her performance quite good. Outlier. ” And the acountant’s word, which I’ve heard 3 years ago, coincides in “Digital Future”2 that regard creativity creates noise.       Ted talk &#8617;        Digital Future &#8617;    "

We have removed one line of code and it is a 178 times faster…#TODOI don’t know where the 5 from. but keep it.

    "body": "2019/10/30 - From the end of last year, big changes have witnessed in NLP research. Embracing an unprecedented growth, I started to study new exciting results and advances. In doing so, I noticed I’m not listed as contributor of repo which my PR accessed. How did I come to a repository?: When I’m stuck, I would prefer to code, than to go deep in theory. (It must be so. . too much to understand 🤒)It was BERT released by Google AI I felt keenly the necessity of implementing, because not only couldn’t understand the way they figured out positional encoding formula, but how it actually works. What does it mean to “scale” dot product in Attention? (Now I know it’s far from my section 😂) Figure 1. Scaled Dot Product. Adopted from tensorflow blogWhat was the code error?: For implement code in paper, I read the papers Transformer and BERT, structured the model, and refered the others’ code. Meanwhile, I found out a small error in tokenization process, which was changing a token into [MASK], enabled bidirectional representation. I’ve made PR, and got merged. But I was not in contributors. Why?: Figure 2. Merged Pull request Adopted from graykode projectActually I happened to know there can be couple of reasons github doesn’t include my name as contributor. Well, if contributors tab has more than 100 people, in which case it shows you up only if you are in the top 100 contributors because displaying too many contributors can make webpages down. Somethimes, however, it doesn’t that problem. Why not? Two possibilities are there.    First, According to Joel-Glovier, if repository maintainer merged-as-a-rebase PR will end up showing as maintainer’s commit. But maintainer shouldn’t normally do this.     Second, if you happend to commit using a different git email that what is in your GitHub profile, it will not be attached to your Github user, and “doesn’t show up” as you.  Reference:  Michał Chromiak’s blog Github: why are my contributions are not showing on my profile atlassian-gitfetch"

    "title": "5 reasons took much time to setting GPU for fast.ai than I expected",
    "body": "2019/10/23 - Motivation: Before now, me as a undergraduate student, I was parsimony who usually depend on colab, kaggle, friend’s server(occasional) whenever i need GPU. . And this time it’s been for a while to install GPU than I expected and I share the several component that stood in my way. Written at Oct 24 2019, if you think this is deprecated, please do not have a leap of faith. Just for the record, I’ve used Kaggle, Colab, GCP, Azure, EC2 as GPU cloud. 1. Did not know there is JupyterLab option in Google Cloud Platform. : At the first time when GCP came out, there was no AI Platform service. So from starting vm instance to launching jupyter and installing packages, I did all of the things myself. (and I learned 🤗) $	curl -O https://repo. continuum. io/archive/Anaconda3-5. 0. 1-Linux-x86_64. sh[Downloading conda in ssh] I created VM instance,selected zone, machine type and disk type. Then, define firewall rules and in ssh terminal, install jupyter and other packages. But you can do all of these things just using AI Platform.  [AI Platform] I think it especially save your time if you are living in Asia-Pacific, which google doesn’t support not that much GPU resources.  2. Consider if the platform has limited resources in a region you live in. : I live in South Korea, East Asia, and it seems like this region has lots of limitation in GPU (except quite expensive AWS) And the Taiwan which was the only one region where I can launch my own VM with GPU (I tried all the other regions in the list) sometimes do normaly, but not always. 😥After launching, I did several works and next day I could not start VM. (I didn’t count it, but tried it a few hours because I didn’t want cost any more time…) Endlessly failed to start instance, then I choose to move AWS as an alternative way. 3. Fast. ai gives deliberate guide and I didn’t know it. : Fast. ai offer the guide for all available platform. (Colab, salamander, Gradient, Kaggle, Colab, and so on) It is so important, and really needs, because cloud computing options are vary as occasion and purpose arise. I didn’t know fast. ai has manual to running GCP, and I think it’s as good a reason as any for me to be have taken time. It helped me so much when I had aws and shortened my time. I don’t want to read all of the manual in amazno. . (It is recommended. . but I’d rather read GIT PRO now…) ssh -i ~/. ssh/&lt;your_private_key_pair&gt; -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 ubuntu@&lt;your instance IP&gt;4. You should wait to add more volume just after add volume, by building AWS EC2. : Since Elastic Block Store(EBS) storage supports optimized storage, users can’t extend storage volume two times in a row.  Unfortunately, at the first time, I didn’t know it (again 👻) and when VM lacked volume, I doubled dist capacity (76*2) at a rough but It needs more.  &lt;!– this time I installed GPU in two years, and it became little complicated compared to 2 years ago. And this time for the first time(maybe not the first time. . but i handled it in my class or with my friend. but it’s my first time on my own. ) I very I’m started to using used google colab, kaggleand, GCP-JupyterLab, ec2 - friend made, aws vm machine but I had a environment variable but i did not know of it. On these days, I could not get a resources from taiwan…    I couldn’t notice a deliberate     Anyway, as a result I tried myself gcp myself and aws ec2 with fast. ai But I think doing on my self surely takes much time (in this point I wonder why I’m doing this, and should remind me, especially I was studying disk volume optimization)     disk volume exceed - https://askubuntu. com/questions/919748/no-space-left-on-device-even-though-there-is:  "
