We have removed one line of code and it is a 178 times faster…#TODOI don’t know where the 5 from. but keep it. Maybe this is related with frobenius norm…?as a result, the code before for k in range(ac):  c[i,j] += a[i,k] + b[k,j]the code after c[i,j] = (a[i,:] * b[:,j]). sum()To compare it (result betweet original and adjusted version) we use not test_eq but other function. The reason for this is that due to rounding errors from math operations, matrices may not be exactly the same. As a result, we want a function that will “is a equal to b within some tolerance” #exportdef near(a,b):   return torch. allclose(a, b, rtol=1e-3, atol=1e-5)def test_near(a,b):   test(a,b,near)test_near(t1, matmul(m1, m2))3.

Tensor instancestride(dim) -&gt; tuple or intReturns the stride of :attr:’self’ tensor. Stride is the jump necessary to go from one element to the next one in the specified dimension :attr:’dim’. A tuple of all strides is returned when no argument is passed in. Otherwise, an integer value is returned as the stride in the particular dimension :attr:’dim’. Args:  dim (int, optional): the desired dimension in which stride is requiredExample::* x = torch. tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])`x. stride()&gt;&gt;&gt; (5, 1)x. stride(0)&gt;&gt;&gt; 5x. stride(-1)&gt;&gt;&gt; 1   unsqueeze &amp; None index   We can manipulate rank of tensor Special value ‘None’, which means please squeeze a new axis here== please broadcast herec = torch. tensor([10,20,30])c[None,:] in c, squeeze a new axis in here please. 2. 2 Matmul with broadcasting: for i in range(ar):#  c[i,j] = (a[i,:]).      *[:,j]. sum() #previous  c[i]  = (a[i]. unsqueeze(-1) * b). sum(dim=0) And Using None also (As howard teached)c[i]  = (a[i ]. unsqueeze(-1) * b). sum(dim=0) #howardc[i]  = (a[i][:,None] * b). sum(dim=0) # using Nonec[i]  = (a[i,:,None]*b). sum(dim=0)⭐️Tips🌟 1) Anytime there’s a trailinng(final) colon in numpy or pytorch you can delete it ex) c[i, :] = c [i]2) any number of colon commas at the start, you can switch it with the single elipsis.  ex) c[:,:,:,:,i] = c […,i] 2. 3 Broadcasting Rules:  What if we tensor. size([1,3]) * tensor. size([3,1])?  torch.

    "title": "4 reasons took much time to setting GPU for fast.ai than I expected",
    "body": "2020/02/05 - Motivation: Before now, me as a undergraduate student, I was parsimony who usually depend on colab, kaggle, friend’s server(occasional) whenever i need GPU. . And this time it’s been for a while to install GPU than I expected and I share the several component that stood in my way. Written at Oct 24 2019, if you think this is deprecated, please do not have a leap of faith. Just for the record, I’ve used Kaggle, Colab, GCP, Azure, EC2 as GPU cloud. 1. Did not know there is JupyterLab option in Google Cloud Platform. : At the first time when GCP came out, there was no AI Platform service. So from starting vm instance to launching jupyter and installing packages, I did all of the things myself. (and I learned 🤗) $	curl -O https://repo. continuum. io/archive/Anaconda3-5. 0. 1-Linux-x86_64. sh[Downloading conda in ssh] I created VM instance,selected zone, machine type and disk type. Then, define firewall rules and in ssh terminal, install jupyter and other packages. But you can do all of these things just using AI Platform.  [AI Platform] I think it especially save your time if you are living in Asia-Pacific, which google doesn’t support not that much GPU resources.  2. Consider if the platform has limited resources in a region you live in. : I live in South Korea, East Asia, and it seems like this region has lots of limitation in GPU (except quite expensive AWS) And the Taiwan which was the only one region where I can launch my own VM with GPU (I tried all the other regions in the list) sometimes do normaly, but not always. 😥After launching, I did several works and next day I could not start VM. (I didn’t count it, but tried it a few hours because I didn’t want cost any more time…) Endlessly failed to start instance, then I choose to move AWS as an alternative way. 3. Fast. ai gives deliberate guide and I didn’t know it. : Fast. ai offer the guide for all available platform. (Colab, salamander, Gradient, Kaggle, Colab, and so on) It is so important, and really needs, because cloud computing options are vary as occasion and purpose arise. I didn’t know fast. ai has manual to running GCP, and I think it’s as good a reason as any for me to be have taken time. It helped me so much when I had aws and shortened my time. I don’t want to read all of the manual in amazno. . (It is recommended. . but I’d rather read GIT PRO now…) ssh -i ~/. ssh/&lt;your_private_key_pair&gt; -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 ubuntu@&lt;your instance IP&gt;4. You should wait to add more volume just after add volume, by building AWS EC2. : Since Elastic Block Store(EBS) storage supports optimized storage, users can’t extend storage volume two times in a row.  Unfortunately, at the first time, I didn’t know it (again 👻) and when VM lacked volume, I doubled dist capacity (76*2) at a rough but It needs more.  &lt;!– this time I installed GPU in two years, and it became little complicated compared to 2 years ago. And this time for the first time(maybe not the first time. . but i handled it in my class or with my friend. but it’s my first time on my own. ) I very I’m started to using used google colab, kaggleand, GCP-JupyterLab, ec2 - friend made, aws vm machine but I had a environment variable but i did not know of it. On these days, I could not get a resources from taiwan…    I couldn’t notice a deliberate     Anyway, as a result I tried myself gcp myself and aws ec2 with fast. ai But I think doing on my self surely takes much time (in this point I wonder why I’m doing this, and should remind me, especially I was studying disk volume optimization)     disk volume exceed - https://askubuntu. com/questions/919748/no-space-left-on-device-even-though-there-is:  "

In doing so, I noticed I’m not listed as contributor of repo which my PR accessed. How did I come to a repository?: When I’m stuck, I would prefer to code, than to go deep in theory. (It must be so. . too much to understand 🤒)It was BERT released by Google AI I felt keenly the necessity of implementing, because not only couldn’t understand the way they figured out positional encoding formula, but how it actually works. What does it mean to “scale” dot product in Attention? (Now I know it’s far from my section 😂) Figure 1. Scaled Dot Product. Adopted from tensorflow blogWhat was the code error?: For implement code in paper, I read the papers Transformer and BERT, structured the model, and refered the others’ code. Meanwhile, I found out a small error in tokenization process, which was changing a token into [MASK], enabled bidirectional representation. I’ve made PR, and got merged. But I was not in contributors. Why?: Figure 2. Merged Pull request Adopted from graykode projectActually I happened to know there can be couple of reasons github doesn’t include my name as contributor. Well, if contributors tab has more than 100 people, in which case it shows you up only if you are in the top 100 contributors because displaying too many contributors can make webpages down. Somethimes, however, it doesn’t that problem. Why not? Two possibilities are there.    First, According to Joel-Glovier, if repository maintainer merged-as-a-rebase PR will end up showing as maintainer’s commit. But maintainer shouldn’t normally do this.     Second, if you happend to commit using a different git email that what is in your GitHub profile, it will not be attached to your Github user, and “doesn’t show up” as you.

One of the concepts I have to know. 1) Kaiming Initializtion in Pytorch was in trouble. 12) Jeremy started to dig in, in lesson09, but I didn’t know why the size of tensor is 2 and even understand this spreadsheet data. 3 Homework: Read Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks paper  What is a convolution?

What is a convolution?: A convolutional neural network is that your red, green, and blue pixels go into the simple computation, and something comes out of that, and then the result of that goes into a second layer, and the result of that goes into the third layer and so forth. Visualization: one kernel Refer this site for visualizing CNN filteringMatthew D Zeiler &amp; Rob Fergus PaperLecture01 {align-items: center;}  nine examples of the actual coefficients from the first layer. Convolution can be represented as matmul: CNNs from different viewpoints {align-items: center;}    [A B C D E F G H I J] is 3 by 3 image data flatten to vector.   As a result, convolution is a just matrix just two things happens     Some of entries are set to zeros at all the times   same color always have the same weight. That called weight time / wegith sharing    So, we can implement a convolution with matrix multiplication. But, we don’t do that because it’s slow!Padding:  What most of libraries do is just put zeros asdie of matrix  fast. ai uses reflection paddings (what is this? Jeremy said he uttered it)Kernel has rank 3:  As standard picture input would be 4 5, it would be actually 3d, not 2d.  If we make kernel as a 3x3 size, we pass over same kernel all the different Red, Green, Blue Pixels.      This could make problem, because, if we want to detect frog, which is green, we would want more activations on the green(I made a test cell in my colab 6)   How can we find a side-edge, a gradient and area of constant weight?: Not top-edge!  One kernel can find only the top-edge, so we should stack the kernels 7 So, we pass it through bunch of kernels to the input images, and that process gives us height x width x corresponding number of kernels.  Usually that number of chanel is 16 And if we want to get the more channels and features, we should repeat that process     This process gives rise to memory out of control, we do the stride   #### conv-example. xlsx  2 convolutional filters At a second layer, filter is 3x3x2 tensor, because to add up together the first layer’s channel.

Oftentimes, analysts and experts are so busy with data and metrics that they seem to forget those things in life that are difficult to measure and perhaps impossible to cluster under statistical models. But I think this is a mistake, for two main reasons. We are emotional beings.     I think it’s going to be one of our biggest intellectual challenges, because our political systems are replete with emotions. In country after country, we have seen illiberal politicians exploiting these emotions. And yet within the academia and among the intelligentsia, we are yet to take emotions seriously.

<p>To compare it (result betweet <em>original</em> and <em>adjusted</em> version) we use not test_eq but other function. The reason for this is that due to rounding errors from math operations, matrices may not be exactly the same. As a result, we want a function that will “is a equal to b <strong>within some tolerance</strong>”</p>

<p>⭐️Tips🌟  <br />
1) <em>Anytime there’s a trailinng(final) colon in numpy or pytorch you can delete it</em>
  <em>ex) c[i, :] = c [i]</em>
2) any number of colon commas at the start, you can switch it with the single elipsis.
  <em>ex) c[:,:,:,:,i] = c […,i]</em></p>

<p>49166.67 times faster than pure python</p>

<p>And we will use this matrix multiplication in Fully Connect forward, with some initialized parameters and ReLU.</p>
