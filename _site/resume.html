(#q) But how do I know if loss decreases slowly or not?   So it will take long time, means too many epochs, resulting overfitting    meaning of learning rate graph: loss graph     (#q) Is it train loss or valid loss what plot shows    lr\_find() goes through (#f)one batch?Jeremy: no, each lr candidate goes through one minibatch for each lr, why steepest? why not minimum?Jeremy: we want our model to enhance learning while training	- (#q) Is this related to fit_one_cycle learning? Unfreezing and transfer learning: (#f) learn. find_tune??(#q) what’s diff from fit_one_cycle?  calling cnn_learner freeze our model, so don’t have to do it seperately We can do better because we just used the same learning rate for a whole trainingDiscriminative learning rates:  use slice at lr_max parameter means discriminative learning rate     why lr_max? first layer use use left value of slice, and last layer use right value of slice (#q)(I need to study more of scheduled learning)   Selecting the number of epochs:    If you choose too big epoch, valid_loss will not change from specific point, and this is related to fit_one_cycle     What fit_one_cycle does?      (#f) ???? - couldn't get why   if error_rate stop from specific epoch, use that epoch as epoch and do it again   Deeper architectures:  Generally people don’t use resnet18, resnet34 about, . to_fp16(): NVIDIJeremy:GPU support special tensor and it’s faster about 2x/3x (#q) import what module?: from fastai2. callback. fp16 import * Try a small model before scaling up the model &lt; because bigger model doesn’t guarantee better performanceJeremy:signment:  Read paper, Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks and see how you can get best results with adjusting learning rate, find out best learning rate by yourself! about . to_fp16() (#f)Jeremy: (#f) (#f)Jeremy: not does machine learning but deep learning specifically.

Is it possible that I make a data loaders with character label like ‘desk’?Jeremy: Yes. Use index if it’s category and will study next time when it’s continuous variable. Binary cross entropy: learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18)x,y = dls. train. one_batch()activs = learn. model(x)activs. shape when you render the one size of batch to the model, you can get an output.

But your pre-trained model is usually for a 3-channel and fastai (#f) could not listen Training a mode: learn. show_results(ds_idx=1, max_n=3, figsize=(6,8)) left of output is target, right is prediction Notice that we used pre-trained model, which did classification task. But it works well when you do regression with it.      why? pre-trained model from ImageNet is collection of image’s features like, objects, color, texture, shadow and so on   so from pre-trained model, we can get the features of an image, and do the other job(e. g. , regression) with fine-tuning   Jeremy:signment:  go to the bear classifier, and find out when you give image which is not included in label and see what happens (#q) why? This will be helpful when you change from multiple-category … (#f) used cross-validation doing machine learning . Do we use it at deep learning?Jeremy: First, nowadays cross-validations are less common(at least at kaggle), because cross-validation was used there were not lots of data. Second, cross-validation is not related selection between machine learning and deep learning  CF algorithm used other than recommendation system. (#f)Jeremy: whatever it’s kind of recommendation system.  how can i make data set if I have video? how split?(time phrase)Jeremy: rank-5 tensor by (time, h, w, batch, (#f)). you can make this theoretically but it is not practically used because too big tensor leads to out of memory Collaborative filtering:  (#todo) Read the fastbook CF algorithm is related to latent variable(;factors) since we don’t have a label explaining/depicting properties which made you choose specific movie     In other words, there is no specific label how we could predict the dependent variable(recommendation; movies user didn’t watch) results from independent var(rating regarding user and movie)     upper and below part represent same info It does dot product and sum with user and movie weight matrixLearning the latent factors:  randomly create user’s factor(;latent, hidden) and movie’s factor. and do matrix multiplication with those, which is dot product.  and sum it and compare with target, so that you can learn parameters, which were randomly initializedCreating the DataLoaders:    Let’s make DataLoaders using basic python and PyTorch!   user and movie is represented using index, label,. . ,called look up in an index but look up in an index is not the thing that deep learning models know how to do with. (#q) why?: I think because it can’t do matrix multiplication     so that we make one-hot encoding matrix    how to do with sparse data?Jeremy: see course rachael’s linear algebra  embedding layer: multiplying by a one hot encoded matrix, using the computational shortcut that it can be implemented by simply indexing directly. (#todo) watch again this part of v3, Jeremy explained with excel     This is important : embedding is not magic, it’s just computational shortcut to make kind of one-hot encoding mat mul with look up index   Collaborative filtering from scratch:  importance of dunder method of python. (like __init__)     explained OOP concept    Inheritance of python Module is fast. ai version of pytorch’s nn. Module Remember Embedding is just kind of shortcut to make a one-hot encoding matrixclass DotProduct(Module):  def __init__(self, n_users, n_movies, n_factors):    self. user_factors = Embedding(n_users, n_factors)    self. movie_factors = Embedding(n_movies, n_factors)      def forward(self, x):    users = self. user_factors(x[:,0])    movies = self. movie_factors(x[:,1])    return (users * movies). sum(dim=1) 64: size of mini_batch, 2: indexx,y = dls. one_batch()x. shapetorch. Size([64, 2])  We use bias to represent specific character of each user and movie, because user/movie weight can’t show users’ character, who usually give good rates, or are fond of animation(movie also) what should we do when model is overfitting very quickly with small epoch(#q) how do we know it’s quick or not? i. e. it’s overfitting or not? what should we do to evade overfitting and don’t want to lessen epoch?     do regularization, which is panalize the fast learning    (#q) why just doesn’t leave it to learn fast?: I think fast learning doesn’t mean model did learn generalized feature. -&gt; then how do we know this is the moment model learned genralized feature? (#q) Isn’t there any side effects when you did too much regularization? Collaborative filtering algorithm works better than svd or kind of that?Jeremy: yes  Use generic Learner not cnn_learner of kind of that. and so that we should render loss function, and model (not using default params)(#todo) comment about hashtags, check toc "

(`draw by your self`)	- but this kernel will catch one feature, like horizontal, so that we make more kernel so that output becomes (h * w * kernel)	- And that `kernel` come to `channel`- **Conv2d**: with 3 by 3 kernel, stride 2 conv -&gt; (h/2 * w/2 * kernel)	- skip or jump over input pixel	- to protect from memory out of control~~~pythonlearn. modellearn. summary()~~~TODO: understand yourself the blocks of conv-kernel: - Usually use big kernel size at first layer (will study this at part2)- Bottom right highlighting kernel(`pic / draw`)- `torch. tensor. expand`: for memory efficient, because we should do RGB- We do not make separate kernel, but make rank 4 kernel	- 4d tensor is just stacked kernel- `t[None]. shape` create new unit axis, and why? we make this -&gt; it should move unit of batch, not one size image. ### Average pooling, feature- suppose our pre-trained model results in size of `11 by 11 by 512 ` `pic 4` and my classification task has 37 classes	* take the first face of channel, which is 11 by 11 and `mean` it, so that make rank 2 tensor, 512 by 1	* and make 2d matrix, which is 512 by 37 and multiply so that we can get 37 by 1 matrix. - Feature, at convolution block	- So, when we transfer-learning without unfreeze, every element of last matrix (512 by 1) should represent(or could catch) each feature. 	### Heatmap, Hook~~~hook_output(model[0]) -&gt; acts -&gt; avg_acts~~~- if we average the block with `axis=feature`, result of matrix(11 by 11) depicts `how activated was that area?` -&gt; it is heatmap, `avg_acts`- and acts comes from hook, which is more advanced pytorch feature. 	- hook into pytorch machine itself, and run any arbitrary Pytorch code	- Why this is cool?: Normally it gives set of outputs of forward pass, but we can interrupt and hook the forward pass. 	- Also can store the output of the convolutional part of the model, which is before avg_pooling- Thinking back when we do cut off `after` the conv part. 	- but with fast. ai the original convolutional part of the model would be *the first thing in the model*, specifically could be given from `learn. model. eval()[0]`	- And this is gotten from `hooked_output` and having hooked the output, we can pass our x_minibatch to output. 	- Not directly, but with normalized, minibatch, put on to the gpu	- `one_item()` function do it, when we have one data `TODO: this is assignment` do it yourself without one_item function	- and `. cuda()` put it on gpu- you should print out very often the shape of tensor, and try think why.

What is a difference between image and imageSegment?: imageSegment  An ImageSegment object has the same properties as an Image. The only difference is that when applying the transformations to an ImageSegment, it will ignore the functions that deal with lighting and keep values of 0 and 1.  It’s easy to show the segmentation mask over the associated Image by using the y argument of show_image. img = open_image(fnames[0])mask = open_mask(lbl_names[0])_,axs = plt. subplots(1,3, figsize=(8,4))img. show(ax=axs[0], title='no mask')img. show(ax=axs[1], y=mask, title='masked') #seg mask over the img using y argmask. show(ax=axs[2], title='mask only', alpha=1. ) vision. image ##4. Why/How img div by 255 and how it results fast. ai : vision. image - If div=True, pixel values are divided by 255. to become floats between 0. and 1.  At times, you want to get rid of distortions caused by lights and shadows in an image.    Normalizing the RGB values of an image can at times be a simple and effective way of achieving this.     So sum of the pixel’s value over all channels(which is S) divides each intensified channel so that nomalized value will be R/S, G/S and B/S (where, S=R+G+B).   Detailed explain here4. Python Evaluation Order: Python evaluates expressions from left to right. Notice that while evaluating an assignment, the right-hand side is evaluated before the left-hand side. mask_tmp, trg_tmp, void_tmp = 2, 1, 10mask_tmp = trg_tmp != void_tmpprint(mask_tmp, trg_tmp, void_tmp) # (1) target is not same with voidTrue 1 10# Example 1x = 1y = 2x,y = y,x+yx, y(2, 3)# Example 2x = 1y = 2x = yy = x+yx, y(2, 4)5. model learner parameter :: pct_start: A: Percentage of total number of epochs when learning rate rises during one cycle. Q: Sorry, I still confused that one cycle in the new API only runs one epoch. How the percentage of total number of epochs works? Can you give a example? If learn. fit_one_cycle(10, slice(1e-4,1e-3,1e-2), pct_start=0. 05)??A: Ok, strictly correct answer would be percentage of iterations, so you can have lr both increase and decrease during same epoch. In your example, say, you have 100 iterations per epoch, then for half an epoch (0. 05 * (10 * 100) = 50) lr will rise, then slowly decrease. Q2: Thanks for this explanation … so essentially, it is the percentage of overall iterations where the LR is increasing, correct? So, given the default of 0. 3, it means that your LR is going up for 30% of your iterations and then decreasing over the last 70%. Is that a correct summation of what is happening? A2: Yes, I think that’s correct. You can verify that by changing its value and check:learn. recorder. plot_lr() For example if pct_start = 0. 2 source: forums. fastai "

We do not calculate each component. But all of the component at once. Because, length of column of A and row of B are fixed.   How much time we saved?  So now that takes 1. 37ms. We have removed one line of code and it is a 178 times faster…#TODOI don’t know where the 5 from. but keep it.

The reason for this is that due to rounding errors from math operations, matrices may not be exactly the same.

What is a convolution?: A convolutional neural network is that your red, green, and blue pixels go into the simple computation, and something comes out of that, and then the result of that goes into a second layer, and the result of that goes into the third layer and so forth. Visualization: one kernel Refer this site for visualizing CNN filteringMatthew D Zeiler &amp; Rob Fergus PaperLecture01     Nine examples of the actual coefficients from the **first layer**  Convolution can be represented as matmul: CNNs from different viewpoints {align-items: center;}    [A B C D E F G H I J] is 3 by 3 image data flatten to vector.   As a result, convolution is a just matrix just two things happens     Some of entries are set to zeros at all the times   same color always have the same weight. That called weight time / wegith sharing    So, we can implement a convolution with matrix multiplication. But, we don’t do that because it’s slow!Padding:  What most of libraries do is just put zeros asdie of matrix  fast. ai uses reflection paddings (what is this? Jeremy said he uttered it)Kernel has rank 3:  As standard picture input would be 4 5, it would be actually 3d, not 2d.  If we make kernel as a 3x3 size, we pass over same kernel all the different Red, Green, Blue Pixels.      This could make problem, because, if we want to detect frog, which is green, we would want more activations on the green(I made a test cell in my colab 6)   How can we find a side-edge, a gradient and area of constant weight?: Not top-edge!  One kernel can find only the top-edge, so we should stack the kernels 7 So, we pass it through bunch of kernels to the input images, and that process gives us height x width x corresponding number of kernels.  Usually that number of chanel is 16 And if we want to get the more channels and features, we should repeat that process     This process gives rise to memory out of control, we do the stride   #### conv-example. xlsx  2 convolutional filters At a second layer, filter is 3x3x2 tensor, because to add up together the first layer’s channel.

Before I came here, it was a little bit vague concept. I’m still not sure ‘what is agile’ but this is how we tried to make agile process.  Daily Stand-up(planning): Sharing the works everyday helps interdisciplinary team to work better. Since product started to get higher fidelity, the gap between engineer and non-engineer increased. Actually I didn’t planned to explain concept because I thougth I would be lose my audience when I start to explain. But as daily stand-up, which shares our progess, goes day by day, I planed and reported the issues. And it made each other’s topic feel more familiar. I think point is very important, because at that point people start to be curious. So we can actively ask to the others, and that momwnr, we can explain the point teammate dosen’t know.     Each color means every different section. Red: Our team goal, Blue: Interaction designer, Green: Product manager, Yellow: Software/AI engineer      This week engineer's main plan  Each of us try to explain what we are doing, but things become easier when we are asked. Because we explained something was important to us before, but if we asked it is something important for the others. Gemba Walk:     Team Cero with core team  Every 2 weeks, we do the Gemba work, which is ‘question everything to the core team’ time. At this period, people can ask anything related to our product, workshop, and framework. Core team will help just for each team, and each team can solve the problem related to their work. &lt; br/&gt;Why we need this session? because with workshop and general schedule, core team has no time just focus on each team. So through this session, we can have opportunity to understand each program and workshop, like why we are using this platform, and when is the due of our small project, and we have this problem and we need help for this. whatever small problem you have, core team is always willing to help you. Sprint Reviews: Every Friday, we have time to summarise what we did for the week. Maybe we need HMW question and our storymap to share our process and then tell and share what we did try, what point we succeeded and what point it was deviant of our prediction, and why we tried it. .     Sprint of Ve-link  And then, just after all team’s ppt, we do vote with such a cute marvel. Always it’s very difficult to vote (of course you can’t vote to your team!) Because it depends on criteria what do I value!But since this is process of our agile work, I try to focus on what they have changed since last week, and why they did it, how they did it. Engineering weekly: Every engineering weekly we exchange our knowledge each other so that we can grow together. Everyone have their knowledge to share and we can be tutor and at the same time can be of tutee. Previously, my AI collegues presented regression, knn. And because I’m somewhat specialized to NLP, I prepared slide that explain about pre-trained language model, but my header advised me if I go deep of theoretical things, I would lose my audience. So I decided to brief BERT mode, how I can contribute to other team’s project. Since BERT was breakthrough of NLP industry, I tried to explain how it can be applied to hands on product and how it can help people in their product. The result was quite motivative to me. They gave feedback that since it wasn’t that much theoretical, they could enjoy it, and useful information. Someone asked me do I had learned of presentation before. I was really happy with their feedback! "

Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks One of the way to find good learning rate. Core idea is to start with small learning rate (like 1e-4, 1e-3) and increase the learning rate after each mini-batch till loss starts exploding. And pick up learning rate one order lower than exploding point. For example, plotted learning rate is like below picture, picking up around 1e-2 is the best way.  Why this methods Traditionally, the learning rate is decreased as the learning starts converging with time. But this paper suggests to cycle our learning rate, because it makes us avoid local minimum. Basically this cyclic method enables us to explore whole of loss function so that find out global minimum. In other words, higher learning rate behaves like regularisation. Let’s find-tune: Do train just one last layer by learning rate found by find_lr This section you should find the strongest downward slope that kind of sticking around for quite a while. And choose just one order lower than lowest point. As explained before, I will pick up 1e-2. And of course, this is fine-tuning, we don’t need discriminative learning rate yet.  Let’s train the whole model!: link When you plot the learning rate again, maybe you will get soaring shape of learning rate. Rule of thumb, When you slice the learning rate, use learning rate you used at unfrozen part. Divide it by 5 or 10 and put it on maximum bound. At minimum bound, get the point just before it soared, and divide it by 10.  Let’s make batch size bigger!: Since default batch size is 64, I tried it to 128. And it gets way more better result(even it’s still underfitting!) And if I freeze model and train whole model again, the model would be better. Also, you can use this method to the other big dataset model training! Interpretation: See the confusion matrix. Result is quite great. *Since I’m using colab, I will skip data cleansing.

    "body": "2020/02/05 - Motivation: Before now, me as a undergraduate student, I was parsimony who usually depend on colab, kaggle, friend’s server(occasional) whenever i need GPU. . And this time it’s been for a while to install GPU than I expected and I share the several component that stood in my way. Written at Oct 24 2019, if you think this is deprecated, please do not have a leap of faith. Just for the record, I’ve used Kaggle, Colab, GCP, Azure, EC2 as GPU cloud. 1. Did not know there is JupyterLab option in Google Cloud Platform. : At the first time when GCP came out, there was no AI Platform service. So from starting vm instance to launching jupyter and installing packages, I did all of the things myself. (and I learned 🤗) $	curl -O https://repo. continuum. io/archive/Anaconda3-5. 0. 1-Linux-x86_64. sh[Downloading conda in ssh] I created VM instance,selected zone, machine type and disk type. Then, define firewall rules and in ssh terminal, install jupyter and other packages. But you can do all of these things just using AI Platform.  [AI Platform] I think it especially save your time if you are living in Asia-Pacific, which google doesn’t support not that much GPU resources.  2. Consider if the platform has limited resources in a region you live in. : I live in South Korea, East Asia, and it seems like this region has lots of limitation in GPU (except quite expensive AWS) And the Taiwan which was the only one region where I can launch my own VM with GPU (I tried all the other regions in the list) sometimes do normaly, but not always. 😥After launching, I did several works and next day I could not start VM. (I didn’t count it, but tried it a few hours because I didn’t want cost any more time…) Endlessly failed to start instance, then I choose to move AWS as an alternative way. 3. Fast. ai gives deliberate guide and I didn’t know it. : Fast. ai offer the guide for all available platform. (Colab, salamander, Gradient, Kaggle, Colab, and so on) It is so important, and really needs, because cloud computing options are vary as occasion and purpose arise. I didn’t know fast. ai has manual to running GCP, and I think it’s as good a reason as any for me to be have taken time. It helped me so much when I had aws and shortened my time. I don’t want to read all of the manual in amazno. . (It is recommended. . but I’d rather read GIT PRO now…) ssh -i ~/. ssh/&lt;your_private_key_pair&gt; -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 ubuntu@&lt;your instance IP&gt;4. You should wait to add more volume just after add volume, by building AWS EC2. : Since Elastic Block Store(EBS) storage supports optimized storage, users can’t extend storage volume two times in a row.  Unfortunately, at the first time, I didn’t know it (again 👻) and when VM lacked volume, I doubled dist capacity (76*2) at a rough but It needs more.  &lt;!– this time I installed GPU in two years, and it became little complicated compared to 2 years ago. And this time for the first time(maybe not the first time. . but i handled it in my class or with my friend. but it’s my first time on my own. ) I very I’m started to using used google colab, kaggleand, GCP-JupyterLab, ec2 - friend made, aws vm machine but I had a environment variable but i did not know of it. On these days, I could not get a resources from taiwan…    I couldn’t notice a deliberate     Anyway, as a result I tried myself gcp myself and aws ec2 with fast. ai But I think doing on my self surely takes much time (in this point I wonder why I’m doing this, and should remind me, especially I was studying disk volume optimization)     disk volume exceed - https://askubuntu. com/questions/919748/no-space-left-on-device-even-though-there-is:  "

What does it mean to “scale” dot product in Attention? (Now I know it’s far from my section 😂) Figure 1. Scaled Dot Product. Adopted from tensorflow blogWhat was the code error?: For implement code in paper, I read the papers Transformer and BERT, structured the model, and refered the others’ code. Meanwhile, I found out a small error in tokenization process, which was changing a token into [MASK], enabled bidirectional representation. I’ve made PR, and got merged. But I was not in contributors. Why?: Figure 2. Merged Pull request Adopted from graykode projectActually I happened to know there can be couple of reasons github doesn’t include my name as contributor. Well, if contributors tab has more than 100 people, in which case it shows you up only if you are in the top 100 contributors because displaying too many contributors can make webpages down. Somethimes, however, it doesn’t that problem. Why not? Two possibilities are there.    First, According to Joel-Glovier, if repository maintainer merged-as-a-rebase PR will end up showing as maintainer’s commit. But maintainer shouldn’t normally do this.     Second, if you happend to commit using a different git email that what is in your GitHub profile, it will not be attached to your Github user, and “doesn’t show up” as you.

I think it’s going to be one of our biggest intellectual challenges, because our political systems are replete with emotions.
