      bio:            "Welcome, I'm dionne. My old hobby is collecting and systemizing data related with me. (I'm with my kindergarten newsletter) I am an observationist. In the meantime, I enjoy the difference between my expectation and result which I've been facinated(my korean-sarcasm project). And I love a film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. Now, I'm interested in AI ethics, and especially studying bias."
